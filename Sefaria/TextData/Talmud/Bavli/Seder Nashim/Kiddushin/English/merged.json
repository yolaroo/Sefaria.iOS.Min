            "￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼Rabban Johanan b. Zakkai used to expound this verse as precious stone. Why was the ear singled out from all the other limbs of the body? The Holy One, blessed be He, said: This ear, which heard my Voice on Mount Sinai when I proclaimed, For unto me the children of Israel are servants, they are my servants, and not servants of servants, and yet this [man] went and acquired a master for himself — let it be bored! R. Simeon b. Rabbi too expounded this verse as a precious stone. Why were the door and doorpost singled out from all other parts10 of the house? The Holy One, blessed be He, said: The door and the doorpost, which were witnesses in Egypt when I passed over the lintel and the doorposts and proclaimed, For unto me the children of Israel are servants, they are my servants,11 and not servants of servants, and so I brought them forth from bondage to freedom, yet this [man] went and acquired a master for himself — let him be bored in their presence!",

One day his wife overheard him. ‘Let me see,’ she reflected, ‘it is so many years that he has separated from me: why then should he say that?’ One day, while he was studying in his garden, she adorned herself with a scarf and strolled in front of him.  ‘Who are you?’ he asked. ‘I am Cheruta, and have returned today,’ she replied. He desired her. Said she to him, ‘Bring me that pomegranate from the uppermost branch.’ He jumped up, went, and brought it to her. When he re-entered his house, his wife was firing the oven,whereupon he went and sat in it. ‘What is this?’ she asked. He told her what had happened.‘It was I,’ she told him; but he paid no heed to her until she gave him proof. ‘Nevertheless,’ said he, ‘my intention was evil.’ That righteous man fasted all his life, until he died from that very death.",
