            "To this may be opposed the following: R' Yehuda said:",
            "When [do they push forward the reading]? In places where the villagers go to town on Monday and Thursday; but in places where they do not go to town on Monday and Thursday, it is read only on the proper day.",
            "But in places where they do go to town on Monday and Thursday,  it is read [on the earlier dates] even in these times.",

            "And because he finds a contradiction between two statements of Rabi Yehuda, is he entitled to ascribe the one in the Barisa to R’ Yose bar R’ Yehuda? ",
            "R’ Ashi had heard some say in the name of R’ Yehuda and some report it in the name of R’ Yose bar R’ Yehuda, and to avoid making R’ Yehuda contradict himself,",

            "The villages [should read] on the fourteenth and those in walled cities on both the fourteenth and fifteenth. As it is written: (Esther 9:21) \"That they should keep the fourteenth day of the month of Adar, and the fifteenth day of the same, yearly.\"",
            "If the text had said, \"the fourteenth day and [we] the fifteenth\", you would have been right. Now, however, that it is written \"the fourteenth day and the fifteenth\" — the Rabbinical Authority comes and makes a distinction:",

            "The text reads: \"That these days should be remembered and kept.\"  'Remembering' is put on the same footing as ‘keeping’.",
            "Our Mishnah does not take the same view as the following Tanna, as it has been taught: \" R' Yehoshua ben Korcha says:",
            "Cities which have been walled since the days of Achashverosh read on the fifteenth.\"",
            "What is the reason of R' Yehoshua ben Korcha?",

            "And what is the reason of our Tanna?",
            "He draws an analogy between the two occurrences of the word \"Perazi\" [villagers]. It is written:(Esther 9:19) \"Therefore the Jews of the villages [Ha-perazim]\". And it is written elsewhere:(Deuteronomy 3:5) \"Beside the unwalled [Ha-perazim] towns, a great many\". Just as there the reference is to towns which were [not] walled in the days of Yehoshua ben Nun, so here the reference is to towns which were [not] walled in the days of Yehoshua ben Nun.",
            "I can understand why R' Yehoshua ben Korchadid not adopt the view of our Tanna; He does not accept the analogy of 'Perazi' and 'Perazi'. But why does not our Tanna accept the view of R' Yehoshua ben Korcha?",
            "Why does our Tanna not [accept the opinion of R' Yehoshua ben Korcha]?",
            "Why, because he draws the analogy of 'perazi' with 'perazi', of course!",
            "What the questioner meant was this: ",
            "[On the view of our Tanna], whom did Shushan follow? It followed neither the villages nor the walled cities!",
            "Raba, or some say, Kadi, replied: ",
            "Shushan was an exception, because a miracle was performed in it.",
            "We can understand according to the view of our Tanna why the text should say:(Esther 9:28) 'Every city' and 'Every town';  'Every city'  to make a distinction between those which were walled in the days of Yehoshua ben Nun and those which were walled in the days of Achashverosh; 'Every  town' likewise to distinguish between Shushan and other towns.",
            "But according to R' Yehoshua ben Korcha, it is true we can account for 'Every city', as being intended to distinguish between Shushan and other cities, but what is the purpose of 'Every town' ?",
            "R' Yehoshua ben Korcha can answer:",
            "And can our Tanna explain the words satisfactorily?",
            "Since he draws the analogy between 'perazi and perazi', why do we require the words ‘Every city’? ",
            "The truth is that the text is inserted as a Drasha, and to teach the rule laid down by R’ Yehoshua ben Levi. ",
            "R’ Yehoshua ben Levi said:",
