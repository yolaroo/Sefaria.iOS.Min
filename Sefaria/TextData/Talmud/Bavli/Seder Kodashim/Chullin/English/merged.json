The Yeshiva Bochrim in the academy came to think that this ruling of rag reflects the view of Rabbi Yehuda. Which of Rabbi Yehuda's mishnayot? It's Rabbi Yehuda about preparation. For it was taught in a mishnah that one can chop up gourds for an animal, or a carcass for a dogs. But Rabbi Yehuda says that if it wasn't a carcass as of shabbat eve, then it's forbidden..."

Who is it [the author of our mishnah] ? If it's the Rabbis, even though it fermented [they would still exempt him], if it was Rabbi Yehudah, even though it did not ferment [he would obligate in tithing].
