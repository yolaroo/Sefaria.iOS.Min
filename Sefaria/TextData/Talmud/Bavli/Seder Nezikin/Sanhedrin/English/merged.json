            "Mishnah: Monetary cases with three [judges]. Theft and injury with three. Damages and half damages, double payment and quadruple and quintuple payment with three. \"Rape, seduction and 'motzi shem ra' (when a husband claims about the virginity of his bride) with three\"—the words of Rabbi Meir. But the Sages say: \"Motzi shem ra with twenty-three, because there is in it [an element of] a capital case.\" Lashes with three. Because of Rabbi Ishmael, they said with twenty-three. \"Intercalation of the month with three. Intercalation of the year with three\"—the words of Rabbi Meir. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: \"We begin with three, with five we argue back and forth, and with seven we finish. But if you finish with three, then it has been intercalated.\"",
            "\"'Semichat Zkeinim' (when the elders put their hands on the sacrifice to atone for a sin of the entire people) and the breaking of the calf's neck (when a body is found between jurisdictions) with three\"—the words of Rabbi Shimon. Rabbi Yehudah says: \"With five.\" 'Chalitzah' (the ceremony of giving up claim to your brother's widow) and 'Miunin' (nullification of a betrothal of a young girl) with three. Produce of the fourth year and second tithe whose value is not known with three. Things dedicated to the Temple with three. [Payment of a] vow with movable property with three. Rabbi Yehudah says: \"One of them should be a priest.\" [Payment of a vow with] immovable property with nine and a priest. A person [in payment of a vow] is like these. Capital cases with twenty-three. Bestiality, either party, with twenty-three, as it is said, \"You shall kill the woman and the beast,\" (Leviticus 20:16), and it says, \"the beast, you shall kill it\" (Leviticus 20:15). Stoned ox with twenty-three, as it is said, \"The ox you will stone and also its master will die\" (Exodus 21:29)—the death of the ox will be like the death of its master. The wolf, lion, bear, tiger, panther and snake—they die with twenty-three. Rabbi Eliezer says: \"Anyone who kills them before is correct.\" But Rabbi Akiva says: \"They die with twenty-three.\"",
            "We do not judge a tribe, false prophet, or the High Priest except based on a court of seventy-one, and we don't go to a permitted war except based on a court of seventy-one. We do not annex a city or region except based on a court of seventy-one. We do not make a Sanhedrin for the tribes except based on a court of seventy-one. We do not proclaim an idolatrous city except based on a court of seventy-one; we do not proclaim an idolatrous city on the border [of the Land of Israel] nor do we proclaim three [idolatrous cities], but we do proclaim one or two. The Great Sanhedrin was with seventy-one, and the smaller twenty-three. How do we know that the greater had seventy-one? As it is said, \"Gather for me seventy people from the elders of Israel\" (Numbers 11:16), and Moses in addition to them. Rabbi Yehudah says: \"Seventy.\" And how do we know that the smaller had twenty-three? As it is said, \"You will judge the congregation and save the congregation\" (Numbers 35:24)—a 'congregation' judges and a 'congregation' saves, thus it is twenty. And how do we know a 'congregation' is ten? As it is said, \"How long for this evil congregation? Then came out Joshua and Caleb\" (Numbers 14:27) [i.e. there were ten evil spies remaining]. And where do we know to add the three? We learn, as it is said, \"Don't go after the majority to convict\" (Exodus 23:2). Should I learn that I should be with them for acquittal? If so, why does it say, \"after the majority [do not] incline\" (Exodus 23:2)? Your inclining to acquittal is not like your inclining to conviction. By one vote shall you incline to acquittal, and by two votes "
        ],
        [
            "and we don't have an even court, so we add another one on those [twenty-two]—thus there are twenty-three. And how many people should there be in a city in order to have a Sanhedrin? One-hundred and twenty. Rabbi Nechemiah said: \"Two-hundred and thirty, so that they correspond to the rulers of ten [of the Israelites in the wilderness].",
            "Gemara: But are thefts and injuries not [in the category] of monetary cases? Rabbi Abahu said: \"[The Mishnah] teaches an exhaustive list. [What are monetary cases?] Thefts and injuries, but confessions and loans are not.\" And [this language] is necessary: for, if it had taught [only] \"monetary cases\", than I would have thought that it included confessions and loans—thus, it teaches \"thefts and injuries\"; but if it had taught \"thefts and injuries\" and not taught \"monetary cases\", I would have thought that this was the law even for confessions and loans and the reason for it teaching \"thefts and injuries\" was because the essential [common factor] is three [judges], since it is written about both thefts and injuries—thefts, as it is written, \"The owner of the house will approach the judges\" (Exodus 22:7); injuries: what difference is an 'injury' in his body or his property? [and I would assume confessions and loans followed the same law]—thus it teaches: \"What are monetary cases? Thefts and injuries, but confessions and loans are not.\" But what [is the difference between thefts and injuries and confessions and loans]? If we say that [confessions and loans] do not require three [judges], did not Rabbi Abahu say that, \"Two that judge monetary cases, their judgement does not stand?\" Rather, [the difference is] that [confessions and loans] do not require experts. What is [the Mishnah's] explanation [for this]? If it holds that 'eruv parashiyot' applies here (a principle connecting one passage in Exodus 23 to another in order to require three judges for monetary cases), then it would require experts [here] also. And if it doesn't hold that 'eruv parashiyot' applies here, why does it [require] three [at all]? [The Mishnah] always holds that 'eruv parashiyot' applies here and that the law should be that we require also experts [in confessions and loans]. But the reason that we do not require experts is because of Rabbi Chanina, as Rabbi Chanina said: \"According to the Torah, monetary and capital cases are the same when it comes to cross-examination [of the witnesses]"
        ],
        [
            "as it says, \"There will be one law for you\" (Leviticus 24:22). ",
            "So what's the reason they said that monetary cases do not require cross-examination? In order to not lock the door before the borrowers [i.e. to make borrowing very difficult].\"",
            "[So too, here, we relax the requirement for experts in confessions and loans in order to not lock the door before the borrowers].—Following this [reasoning], if [the judge] errs, he should not [have to pay for his mistake]!",
            "All the more so [would this] be locking the door before the borrowers.",
            "If so, [the Mishnah] teaches two things:",
            "\"Monetary cases with three laypeople, thefts and injuries with three experts.\"",
            "And further,",
            "why does it say \"three\" twice?",
            "Rather, Rava said:",

            "\"From the Torah, one [judge] would also be fitting, as it is said, 'With justice shall you judge your people' (Leviticus 19:15).\"—But is it because of the problem of tramps at street corners [judging confessions and loans that we require] three? [No, for] how could it be with [three] tramps at street corners that one of them wasn't learned? Following from this [reasoning], if they err [perhaps] they shouldn't [have to] pay? All the more so would this increase [the problem of] tramps at street corners [judging confessions and loans].—What is the difference between [the positions of] Rava and Rav Acha son of Rav Ika? This is the difference: as Shmuel said, \"Two [judges] that judge a case, their judgements stand but they are called a rebellious court\"—Rava holds according to Shmuel, Rav Acha son of Rav Ika does not hold according to Shmuel.",

It is taught \"money\", and it taught \"fine\" [i.e. the Mishnah teaches that half-damages are fines, not ordinary monetary cases]. This is fine for the person who said that half-damages is a fine, but for the one who said that half-damages is money, what is there for him to say?

            "Three [judges]—where [do we know this] from?! As our rabbis taught: \"'\"The owner will come before the judges [HaElohim, lit. God]\" (Exodus 22:7)—this is one. \"The matter of both [litigants] shall come before the judges [HaElohim]\" (Exodus 22:8)—this is two. \"Which the judges [HaElohim] shall declare guilty\" (Exodus 22:8)—this is three.\"—the words of Rabbi Yoshayah. Rabbi Yonatan says: 'The first was stated as a first instance and we don't expound from first instances [i.e. we can't use the first appearance of a word in our explanation]. Instead, \"The matter of both [litigants] shall come before the judges [HaElohim]\" (Exodus 22:8)—this is one. \"Which the judges [HaElohim] shall declare guilty\" (Exodus 22:8)—this is two. There are no even-numbered courts so we add upon them another one—this is three.'\" Let us say that it is about [this principle] of not expounding from first instances that they disagree, that one master things we do expound from first instances and the other master thinks we do not expound from first instances. No! According to everyone we don't expound from first instances. Rabbi Yoshayah would say to you: \"If so, the verse should state 'the owner shall come to the judge [hashofet]'! Why 'to God [HaElohim]'?\" We learn from this that [this word] is in the counting. And Rabbi Yonatan [would say to you]: \"It is using normal language—as people say—for a person who has a case to bring to the judge.\" But does Rabbi Yoshayah not hold by [the principle] of [not having] an odd-numbered court? Is it not taught: \"Rabbi Eliezer son of Rabbi Yose HaGlili said: 'What does the verse teach, \"After the majority you should incline\" (Exodus 23:2)? \"To incline\"—the Torah says, \"Make for yourself an odd-numbered court\" [lit. an inclined court]'\"?! He thinks according to Rabbi Yehudah, who says \"seventy\", as it is taught: \"The Great Sanhedrin had seventy-one. But Rabbi Yehudah says: 'Seventy'.\" Let's say that you learn this for Rabbi Yehudah concerning the Great Sanhedrin as the verses are written; with all other courts, could you learn this for him? Or you could say there's no difference [between the Great Sanhedrin and other courts], for is it not taught: \"'The laying of the hands of the elders and the ceremony of the breaking of the calf's neck with three [judges]'—the words of Rabbi Shimon. And Rabbi Yehudah says: 'With five'\"—and we say what the reasoning is for Rabbi Yehudah: \"'They will lay their hands'—this is two; 'elders'—this is two (Leviticus 4:15)—and there is no even-numbered court, so we add upon them another one—this is five.\"!? Rabbi Yoshayah['s opinion] seems more forceful than Rabbi Yehudah's, because if with the Great Sanhedrin Rabbi Yehudah does not have [the requirement of having an odd-numbered court] then in all other courts he does; but Rabbi Yoshayah, in all other courts he does not also. However, what does [Rabbi Yoshayah] do [with the word] \"to incline\"? He assigns it to capital cases but not to monetary cases. But it is taught [in the Mishnah]: \"Two [judges] that say he is acquitted, one that says he is liable, he is acquitted; two that say he is liable, one that says he is acquitted, he is liable\"! [I.e. it assumes majority rule in monetary cases]. Can we say that this [Mishnah] is not in accordance with Rabbi Yoshayah? No! It can even be said from Rabbi Yoshayah['s view]. He would derive it from a kal vahomer (a principle deriving the law for a more lenient case from a more stringent case) from capital cases. Since capital cases are so stringent and God says, \"Go after the majority\", all the more so in monetary cases.",
            "Our rabbis taught: \"Monetary cases with three [judges]; Rabbi said: 'With five, so that the case will be completed with three [i.e. the ruling will come from at least three judges].'\" But if we have three, can the case not be completed with two? This is what [Rabbi] meant: \"Because the case is completed with three.\" Therefore, when the Torah says three, it is written concerning the case's completion. Rabbi Abahu ridiculed this: \"From this [reasoning], the Great Sanhedrin would need one-hundred and forty-one in order to complete the case with seventy-one! And the lesser Sanhedrin would need forty-five in order to complete the case with twenty-three! Rather, 'Gather me seventy people' (Numbers 11:16); God says, from the time of gathering [there should be] seventy.  'Judge the congregation; save the congregation' (Numbers 35:24) is also from the time of judging the congregation. So too, 'The owner shall approach the judges' (Exodus 22:7) is from the time of approach. Rather, this is the reasoning of Rabbi: 'That the judges [HaElohim, in the plural] declare guilty' (Exodus 22:8)—two. Judges [Elohim] is said below and is said above; just as below [it indicates] two, so too above [it indicates] two, and there is no even-numbered court, [so we] add upon them an additional one—this is five.\"",

        [
            "and the Sages [who say three judges come to this conclusion because] it is written \"he will make them guilty\" [instead of \"they will make them guilty\" as it is read—thus there is one above, one below, and then add another because there are no even-numbered courts—this is three]. Rabbi Yitzhak son of [Yose] said that Rabbi Yohanan said: \"Rabbi, Rabbi Yehudah son of Ro'etz, Bet Shammai, Rabbi Shimon and Rabbi Akiva all think that the way the Torah is read takes precedence [over the way in which it is written when deriving law from biblical passages].\" Rabbi, as we already said. Rabbi Yehudah son of Ro'etz, as it is taught: \"His students asked Rabbi Yehudah son of Ro'etz, 'I read \"two weeks [shvu'ayim]\" (Leviticus 12:5) [for the period of impurity after a female child is born]. But perhaps the birth of a female [child] should cause impurity for seventy [shiv'im] [days]?' He said to them, 'There is impurity and purity for a male, and there is impurity and purity for a female. Just as the [period of] purity for a female is double that for a male [in length], so too is the [period of] impurity for a female is double that for a male.' After they left, he left and followed after them. He said to them, 'You don't need to rely on what I said! We read \"two weeks [shvu'ayim]\" and the way the Torah is read takes precedence.'\" Beit Shammai, as it is taught: \"Beit Shammai say: 'For all that is offered on the outer altar, given as an offering, one [sprinkling of the sacrifice's blood on the corner of the altar], then it atones (as it is said, \"The blood of your sacrifice you should pour\" (Deuteronomy 12:27)); but for a sin offering, two [sprinklings are required].' And Beit Hillel say: 'Even for the sin offering that is given as an offering, one [sprinkling atones].'\" And Rav Huna said: \"What the reason of Beit Shammai? [We read] 'kranot', 'kranot', 'kranot', (corners, each plural) (Leviticus 4:7)—this is six [sprinklings]: four ideally, but two suffice; but Beit Hillel say: [it is written] 'kranot', 'karnat', 'karnat' (one plural, two singular)—this is four [sprinklings]: three ideally, and one suffices.\" But let us say [according to Beit Hillel] that all [of the sprinklings] are for the ideal [case]? [No!] We don't find that [one can get] atonement with zero [sprinklings]. Rabbi Shimon, as it is taught: \"Two [walls for the Sukkah] according to their law, and a third [that can be as small as] even a hand-breadth. But Rabbi Shimon says: 'Three according to their law, and a fourth [that can be as small as] even a hand-breadth.'\" What are they disagreeing about? The Sages [the anonymous opinion in the Mishnah] think that the way the Torah is written takes precedence, and Rabbi Shimon thinks that the way the Torah is read takes precedence. The Sages think that the way the Torah is written takes precedence, \"besukkat\", \"besukkat\", \"besukkot\" (two singular, one plural)"

I said unto Jacob (Gen 29): \"The land which thouh liest on, to thee will I give it and unto thy seed\" - He sought a place to pitch his tent and did not find until he acquired it for a hundred kesitah - yet he did not question my ways, and did not ask Me what was My name as you have asked.  Yet you at the beginning of My mission did say to Me, \"What is His name?\"  And at the end you  did say (Exodus 5:23): \"Since I came to speak in Your name, he has done evil to this people.\" (Genesis Rabbah 6:4)",
