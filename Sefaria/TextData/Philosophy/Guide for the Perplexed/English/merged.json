                "[Letter of the Author to his Pupil, R. Joseph Ibn Aknin.] In the name of GOD, Lord of the Universe.",
                "To R. Joseph (may God protect him!), son of R. Jehudah (may his repose be in Paradise!):",
                "\"My dear pupil, ever since you resolved to come to me, from a distant country, and to study under my direction, I thought highly of your thirst for knowledge, and your fondness for speculative pursuits, which found expression in your poems. I refer to the time when I received your writings in prose and verse from Alexandria. I was then not yet able to test your powers of apprehension, and I thought that your desire might possibly exceed your capacity. But when you had gone with me through a course of astronomy, after having completed the [other] elementary studies which are indispensable for the understanding of that science, I was still more gratified by the acuteness and the quickness of your apprehension. Observing your great fondness for mathematics, I let you study them more deeply, for I felt sure of your ultimate success. Afterwards, when I took you through a course of logic, I found that my great expectations of you were confirmed, and I considered you fit to receive from me an exposition of the esoteric ideas contained in the prophetic books, that you might understand them as they are understood by men of culture. When I commenced by way of hints, I noticed that you desired additional explanation, urging me to expound some metaphysical problems; to teach you the system of the Mutakallemim; to tell you whether their arguments were based on logical proof; and if not, what their method was. I perceived that you had acquired some knowledge in those matters from others, and that you were perplexed and bewildered; yet you sought to find out a solution to your difficulty. I urged you to desist from this pursuit, and enjoined you to continue your studies systematically; for my object was that the truth should present itself in connected order, and that you should not hit upon it by mere chance. Whilst you studied with me I never refused to explain difficult verses in the Bible or passages in rabbinical literature which we happened to meet.",
                "When, by the will of God, we parted, and you went your way, our discussions aroused in me a resolution which had long been dormant. Your absence has prompted me to compose this treatise for you and for those who are like you, however few they may be. I have divided it into chapters, each of which shall be sent to you as soon as it is completed. Farewell!\"",
                "[Prefatory Remarks.] \"Cause me to know the way wherein I should walk, for I lift up my soul unto Thee.\" (Psalms 143:8) \"Unto you, 0 men, I call, and my voice is to the sons of men.\" (Proverbs 8:4) \"Bow down thine ear and hear the words of the wise, and apply thine heart unto my knowledge.\" (Proverbs 22:17)",
                "My primary object in this work is to explain certain words occurring in the prophetic books. Of these some are homonyms, and of their several meanings the ignorant choose the wrong ones; other terms which are employed in a figurative sense are erroneously taken by such persons in their primary signification. There are also hybrid terms, denoting things which are of the same class from one point of view and of a different class from another. It is not here intended to explain all these expressions to the unlettered or to mere tyros, a previous knowledge of Logic and Natural Philosophy being indispensable, or to those who confine their attention to the study of our holy Law, I mean the study of the canonical law alone; for the true knowledge of the Torah is the special aim of this and similar works. The object of this treatise is to enlighten a religious man who has been trained to believe in the truth of our holy Law, who conscientiously fulfills his moral and religious duties, and at the same time has been successful in his philosophical studies. Human reason has attracted him to abide within its sphere; and he finds it difficult to accept as correct the teaching based on the literal interpretation of the Law, and especially that which he himself or others derived from those homonymous, metaphorical, or hybrid expressions. Hence he is lost in perplexity and anxiety. If he be guided solely by reason, and renounce his previous views which are based on those expressions, he would consider that he had rejected the fundamental principles of the Law; and even if he retains the opinions which were derived from those expressions, and if, instead of following his reason, he abandon its guidance altogether, it would still appear that his religious convictions had suffered loss and injury. For he would then be left with those errors which give rise to fear and anxiety, constant grief and great perplexity.",
                "This work has also a second object in view. It seeks to explain certain obscure figures which occur in the Prophets, and are not distinctly characterized as being figures. Ignorant and superficial readers take them in a literal, not in a figurative sense. Even well informed persons are bewildered if they understand these passages in their literal signification, but they are entirely relieved of their perplexity when we explain the figure, or merely suggest that the terms are figurative. For this reason I have called this book Guide for the Perplexed.",
                "I do not presume to think that this treatise settles every doubt in the minds of those who understand it, but I maintain that it settles the greater part of their difficulties. No intelligent man will require and expect that on introducing any subject I shall completely exhaust it; or that on commencing the exposition of a figure I shall fully explain all its parts. Such a course could not be followed by a teacher in a viva vote exposition, much less by an author in writing a book, without becoming a target for every foolish conceited person to discharge the arrows of folly at him.",
                "Some general principles bearing upon this point have been fully discussed in our works on the Talmud, and we have there called the attention of the reader to many themes of this kind. We also stated (Mishneh Torah, Yesodey haTorah 2:12, and Mishneh Torah, Yesodey haTorah 4:10) that the expression Ma'ase Bereshit (\"Account of the Creation\") signified \"Natural Science,\" and Ma'aseh Mercabah (\"Description of the Chariot\") Metaphysics, and we explained the force of the Rabbinical dictum, \"The Ma'aseh Mercabah must not be fully expounded even in the presence of a single student, unless he be wise and able to reason for himself, and even then you should merely acquaint him with the heads of the different sections of the subject.\" (Chagigah 13a). You must, therefore, not expect from me more than such heads. And even these have not been methodically and systematically arranged in this work, but have been, on the contrary, scattered, and are interspersed with other topics which we shall have occasion to explain. My object in adopting this arrangement is that the truths should be at one time apparent, and at another time concealed. Thus we shall not be in opposition to the Divine Will (from which it is wrong to deviate) which has withheld from the multitude the truths required for the knowledge of God, according to the words, \"The secret of the Lord is with them that fear Him\" (Psalms 25:14).",
                "Know that also in Natural Science there are topics which are not to be fully explained. Our Sages laid down the rule, \"The Ma'aseh Bereshith must not be expounded in the presence of two.\" If an author were to explain these principles in writing, it would be equal to expounding them unto thousands of men. For this reason the prophets treat these subjects in figures, and our Sages, imitating the method of Scripture, speak of them in metaphors and allegories; because there is a close affinity between these subjects and metaphysics, and indeed they form part of its mysteries.",
                "Do not imagine that these most difficult problems can be thoroughly understood by any one of us. This is not the case. At times the truth shines so brilliantly that we perceive it as clear as day. Our nature and habit then draw a veil over our perception, and we return to a darkness almost as dense as before. We are like those who, though beholding frequent flashes of lightning, still find themselves in the thickest darkness of the night.",
                "On some the lightning flashes in rapid succession, and they seem to be in continuous light, and their night is as clear as the day. This was the degree of prophetic excellence attained by (Moses) the greatest of prophets, to whom God said, \"But as for thee, stand thou here by Me\" (Deuteronomy 5:31), and of whom it is written \"the skin of his face shone,\" etc. (Exodus 34:29). [Some perceive the prophetic flash at long intervals; this is the degree of most prophets.] By others only once during the whole night is a flash of lightning perceived. This is the case with those of whom we are informed, \"They prophesied, and did not prophesy again\" (Numbers 11:25). There are some to whom the flashes of lightning appear with varying intervals;",
                "others are in the condition of men, whose darkness is illumined not by lightning, but by some kind of crystal or similar stone, or other substances that possess the property of shining during the night; and to them even this small amount of light is not continuous, but now it shines and now it vanishes,  as if it were \"the flame of the rotating sword.\" The degrees in the perfection of men vary according to these distinctions. Concerning those who never beheld the light even for one day, but walk in continual darkness, it is written, \"They know not, neither will they understand; they walk on in darkness\" (Psalms 82:5). Truth, in spite of all its powerful manifestations, is completely withheld from them, and the following words of Scripture may be applied to them,\" And now men see not the light which is bright in the skies\" (Job 37:21). They are the multitude of ordinary men: there is no need to notice them in this treatise.",
                "You must know that if a person, who has attained a certain degree of perfection, wishes to impart to others, either orally or in writing, any portion of the knowledge which he has acquired of these subjects, he is utterly unable to be as systematic and explicit as he could be in a science of which the method is well known. The same difficulties which he encountered when investigating the subject for himself will attend him when endeavouring to instruct others: viz., at one time the explanation will appear lucid, at another time, obscure: this property of the subject appears to remain the same both to the advanced scholar and to the beginner.",
                "For this reason, great theological scholars gave instruction in all such matters only by means of metaphors and allegories. They frequently employed them in forms varying more or less essentially. In most cases they placed the lesson to be illustrated at the beginning, or in the middle, or at the end of the simile. When they could find no simile which from beginning to end corresponded to the idea which was to be illustrated, they divided the subject of the lesson, although in itself one whole, into different parts, and expressed each by a separate figure. Still more obscure are those instances in which one simile is employed to illustrate many subjects, the beginning of the simile representing one thing, the end another. Sometimes the whole metaphor may refer to two cognate subjects in the same branch of knowledge. If we were to teach in these disciplines, without the use of parables and figures, we should be compelled to resort to expressions both profound and transcendental, and by no means more intelligible than metaphors and similes: as though the wise and learned were drawn into this course by the Divine Will, in the same way as they are compelled to follow the laws of nature in matters relating to the body.",
                "You are no doubt aware that the Almighty, desiring to lead us to perfection and to improve our state of society, has revealed to us laws which are to regulate our actions. These laws, however, presuppose an advanced state of intellectual culture. We must first form a conception of the Existence of the Creator according to our capabilities; that is, we must have a knowledge of Metaphysics. But this discipline can only be approached after the study of Physics: for the science of Physics borders on Metaphysics, and must even precede it in the course of our studies, as is clear to all who are familiar with these questions. Therefore the Almighty commenced Holy Writ with the description of the Creation, that is, with Physical Science; the subject being on the one hand most weighty and important, and on the other hand our means of fully comprehending those great problems being limited. He described those profound truths, which His Divine Wisdom found it necessary to communicate to us, in allegorical, figurative, and metaphorical language. Our Sages have said (Yemen Midrash on Gen. 1:1): \"It is impossible to give a full account of the Creation to man. Therefore Scripture simply tells us, In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth\" (Genesis 1:1). Thus they have suggested that this subject is a deep mystery, and in the words of Solomon, \"Far off and exceedingly deep, who can find it out?\" (Ecclesiastes 7:24). It has been treated in metaphors in order that the uneducated may comprehend it according to the measure of their faculties and the feebleness of their apprehension, while educated persons may take it in a different sense.",
                "In our commentary on the Mishnah we stated our intention to explain difficult problems in the Book on Prophecy and in the Book of Harmony. In the latter we intended to examine all the passages in the Midrash which, if taken literally, appear to be inconsistent with truth and common sense, and must therefore be taken figuratively. Many years have elapsed since I first commenced those works. I had proceeded but a short way when I became dissatisfied with my original plan. For I observed that by expounding these passages by means of allegorical and mystical terms, we do not explain anything, but merely substitute one thing for another of the same nature, whilst in explaining them fully our efforts would displease most people; and my sole object in planning to write those books was to make the contents of Midrashirn and the exoteric lessons of the prophecies intelligible to everybody. We have further noticed that when an ill-informed Theologian reads these Midrashim, he will find no difficulty; for possessing no knowledge of the properties of things, he will not reject statements which involve impossibilities. When, however, a person who is both religious and well educated reads them, he cannot escape the following dilemma: either he takes them literally, and questions the abilities of the author and the soundness of his mind-doing thereby nothing which is opposed to the principles of our faith,-- or he will acquiesce in assuming that the passages in question have some secret meaning, and he will continue to hold the author in high estimation whether he understood the allegory or not. As regards prophecy in its various degrees and the different metaphors used in the prophetic books, we shall give in the present work an explanation, according to a different method. Guided by these considerations I have refrained from writing those two books as I had previously intended. In my larger work, the Mishneh Torah, I have contented myself with briefly stating the principles of our faith and its fundamental truths, together with such hints as approach a clear exposition.",
                "In this work, however, I address those who have studied philosophy and have acquired sound knowledge, and who while firm in religious matters are perplexed and bewildered on account of the ambiguous and figurative expressions employed in the holy writings. Some chapters may be found in this work which contain no reference whatever to homonyms. Such chapters will serve as an introduction to others: they will contain some reference to the signification of a homonym which I do not wish to mention in that place, or explain some figure: point out that a certain expression is a figure: treat of difficult passages generally misunderstood in consequence of the homonymy they include, or because the simile they contain is taken in place of that which it represents, and vice versa.",
                "Having spoken of similes, I proceed to make the following remark:-The key to the understanding and to the full comprehension of all that the Prophets have said is found in the knowledge of the figures, their general ideas, and the meaning of each word they contain. You know the verse: \"I have also spoken in similes by the Prophets\" (Hosea 12:10): and also the verse, \"Put forth a riddle and speak a parable\" (Ezekiel 17:2). And because the Prophets continually employ figures, Ezekiel said,\" Does He not speak parables?\" (Ezekiel 21:5). Again, Solomon begins his book of Proverbs with the words, \"To understand a proverb and figurative speech, the words of the wise and their dark sayings\" (Proverbs 1:6): and we read in Midrash, (Shir Hashirim Rabbah 1:1): \"To what were the words of the Law to be compared before the time of Solomon? To a well the waters of which are at a great depth, and though cool and fresh, yet no man could drink of them. A clever man joined cord with cord, and rope with rope, and drew up and drank. So Solomon went from figure to figure, and from subject to subject, till he obtained the true sense of the Law.\" So far go the words of our Sages. I do not believe that any intelligent man thinks that\" the words of the Law\" mentioned here as requiring the application of figures in order to be understood, can refer to the rules for building tabernacles, for preparing the lulab, or for the four kinds of trustees. What is really meant is the apprehension of profound and difficult subjects, concerning which our Sages said,\" If a man loses in his house a sela, or a pearl, he can find it by lighting a taper worth only one issar. Thus the parables in themselves are of no great value, but through them the words of the holy Law are rendered intelligible.\" These likewise are the words of our Sages; consider well their statement, that the deeper sense of the words of the holy Law are pearls, and the literal acceptation of a figure is of no value in itself. They compare the hidden meaning included in the literal sense of the simile to a pearl lost in a dark room, which is full of furniture. It is certain that the pearl is in the room, but the man can neither see it nor know where it lies. It is just as if the pearl were no longer in his possession, for, as has been stated, it affords him no benefit whatever until he kindles a light. The same is the case with the comprehension of that which the simile represents.",
                "The wise [king] said,\" A word fitly spoken is like apples of gold in vessels of silver\" (Prov. 25:11). Hear the explanation of what he said:-The word maskiyyoth, the Hebrew equivalent for\" vessels,\" denotes\" filigree network\" --i.e., things in which there are very small apertures, such as are frequently wrought by silversmiths. They are called in Hebrew maskiyyoth (lit.\" transpicuous,\" from the verb sakah,\" he saw,\" a root which occurs also in the Targum of Onkelos, Gen. 26:8), because the eye penetrates through them. Thus Solomon meant to say,\" just as apples of gold in silver filigree with small apertures, so is a word fitly spoken.\" See how beautifully the conditions of a good simile are described in this figure! It shows that in every word which has a double sense, a literal one and a figurative one, the plain meaning must be as valuable as silver, and the hidden meaning still more precious: so that the figurative meaning bears the same relation to the literal one as gold to silver. It is further necessary that the plain sense of the phrase shall give to those who consider it some notion of that which the figure represents. Just as a golden apple overlaid with a network of silver, when seen at a distance, or looked at superficially, is mistaken for a silver apple, but when a keen-sighted person looks at the object well, he will find what is within, and see that the apple is gold. The same is the case with the figures employed by prophets. Taken literally, such expressions contain wisdom useful for many purposes, among others, for the amelioration of the condition of society; e.g., the Proverbs (of Solomon), and similar sayings in their literal sense. Their hidden meaning, however, is profound wisdom, conducive to the recognition of real truth.",
                "Know that the figures employed by prophets are of two kinds: first, where every word which occurs in the simile represents a certain idea: and secondly, where the simile, as a whole, represents a general idea, but has a great many points which have no reference whatever to that idea: they are simply required to give to the simile its proper form and order, or better to conceal the idea: the simile is therefore continued as far as necessary, according to its literal sense. Consider this well.",
                "An example of the first class of prophetic figures is to be found in Genesis:-\"And, behold, a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven; and, behold, the angels of God ascending and descending on it\" (Genesis 28:12). The word\" ladder\" refers to one idea:\" set up on the earth\" to another: \"and the top of it reached to heaven\" to a third: 4' angels of God\" to a fourth:\" ascending\" to a fifth; \"descending\" to a sixth;\" the Lord stood above it\" (Gen. 28:13) to a seventh. Every word in this figure introduces a fresh element into the idea represented by the figure. An example of the second class of prophetic figures is found in Proverbs (Proverbs 7:6-26):--\" For at the window of my house I looked through my casement, and beheld among the simple ones; I discerned among the youths a young man void of understanding, passing through the street near her corner: and he went the way to her house, in the twilight, in the evening, in the black and dark night: and, behold, there met him a woman with the attire of a harlot, and subtil of heart. (She is loud and stubborn; her feet abide not in her house: now the is without, now in the streets, and lieth in wait in every corner.) So she caught him, and kissed him, and with an impudent face said unto him, I have peace offerings with me; this day have I paid my vows. Therefore came I forth to meet thee, diligently to seek thy face, and I have found thee. I have decked my bed with coverings of tapestry, with striped cloths of the yam of Egypt. I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon. Come, let us take our fill of love until the morning: let us solace ourselves with loves. For the goodman is not at home, he is gone a long journey: he hath taken a bag of money with him, and will come home at the day appointed. With her much fair speech she caused him to yield, with the flattering of her lips she forced him. He goeth after her straightway, as an ox goeth to the slaughter, or as fetters to the correction of a fool: till a dart strike through his liver: as a bird hasteth to the snare, and knoweth not that it is for his life. Hearken unto me now therefore, o ye children, and attend to the words of my mouth. Let not thine heart decline to her ways, go not astray in her paths. For she hath cast down many wounded: yea, many strong men have been slain by her.\" The general principle expounded in all these verses is to abstain from excessive indulgence in bodily pleasures. The author compares the body, which is the source of all sensual pleasures, to a married woman who at the same time is a harlot. And this figure he has taken as the basis of his entire book. We shall hereafter show the wisdom of Solomon in comparing sensual pleasures to an adulterous harlot. We shall explain how aptly he concludes that work with the praises of a faithful wife who devotes herself to the welfare of her husband and of her household. All obstacles which prevent man from attaining his highest aim in life, all the deficiencies in the character of man, all his evil propensities, are to be traced to the body alone. This will be explained later on. The predominant idea running throughout the figure is, that man shall not be entirely guided by his animal, or material nature; for the material substance of man is identical with that of the brute creation. An adequate explanation of the figure having been given, and its meaning having been shown, do not imagine that you will find in its application a corresponding element for each part of the figure; you must not ask what is meant by\" I have peace offerings with me\" (ver. 14): by\" I have decked my bed with coverings of tapestry\" (ver. 16): or what is added to the force of the figure by the observation\" for the good man is not at home\" (ver. 19), and so on to the end of the chapter. For all this is merely to complete the illustration of the metaphor in its literal meaning. The circumstances described here are such as are common to adulterers. Such conversations take place between all adulterous persons.",
                "You must well understand what I have said, for it is a principle of the utmost importance with respect to those things which I intend to expound. If you observe in one of the chapters that I explained the meaning of a certain figure, and pointed out to you its general scope, do not trouble yourself further in order to find an interpretation of each separate portion, for that would lead you to one of the two following erroneous courses: either you will miss the sense included in the metaphor, or you will be induced to explain certain things which require no explanation, and which are not introduced for that purpose. Through this unnecessary trouble you may fall into the great error which besets most modern sects in their foolish writings and discussions: they all endeavour to find some hidden meaning in expressions which were never uttered by the author in that sense. Your object should be to discover inmost of the figures the general idea which the author wishes to express. In some instances it will be sufficient if you understand from my remarks that a certain expression contains a figure, although I may offer no further comment. For when you know that it is not to be taken literally, you will understand at once to what subject it refers. My statement that it is a figurative expression will, as it were, remove the screen from between the object and the observer."

                "[Directions for the Study of this Work] If you desire to grasp all that is contained in this book so that nothing shall escape your notice, consider the chapters in connected order. In studying each chapter, do not content yourself with comprehending its principal subject, but attend to every term mentioned therein, although it may seem to have no connection with the principal subject. For what I have written in this work was not the suggestion of the moment: it is the result of deep study and great application. Care has been taken that nothing that appeared doubtful should be left unexplained. Nothing of what is mentioned is out of place, every remark will be found to illustrate the subject-matter of the respective chapter. Do not read superficially, lest you do me an injury, and derive no benefit for yourself. You must study thoroughly and read continually; for you will then find the solution of those important problems of religion, which are a source of anxiety to all intelligent men. ",
                "I adjure any reader of my book, in the name of the Most High, not to add any explanation even to a single word: nor to explain to another any portion of it except such passages as have been fully treated of by previous theological authorities: he must not teach others anything that he has learned from my work alone, and that has not been hitherto discussed by any of our authorities. The reader must, moreover, beware of raising objections to any of my statements, because it is very probable that he may understand my words to mean the exact opposite to what I intended to say. He will injure me, while I endeavored to benefit him.\" He will requite me evil for good.\"  ",
                "Let the reader make a careful study of this work; and if his doubt be removed on even one point, let him praise his Maker and rest contented with the knowledge he has acquired. But if he derive from it no benefit whatever, he may consider the book as if it had never been written. Should he notice any opinions with which he does not agree, let him endeavor to find a suitable explanation, even if it seem far-fetched, in order that he may judge me charitably. Such a duty we owe to every one. We owe it especially to our scholars and theologians, who endeavor to teach us what is the truth according to the best of their ability.  ",
                "I feel assured that those of my readers who have not studied philosophy, will still derive profit from many a chapter. But the thinker whose studies have brought him into collision with religion, will, as I have already mentioned, derive much benefit from every chapter. How greatly will he rejoice! How agreeably will my words strike his ears! Those, however, whose minds are confused with false notions and perverse methods, who regard their misleading studies as sciences, and imagine themselves philosophers, though they have no knowledge that could truly be termed science, will object to many chapters, and will find in them many insuperable difficulties, because they do not understand their meaning, and because I expose therein the absurdity of their perverse notions, which constitute their riches and peculiar treasure,\" stored up for their ruin.\" ",
                "God knows that I hesitated very much before writing on the subjects contained in this work, since they are profound mysteries: they are topics which, since the time of our captivity have not been treated by any of our scholars as far as we possess their writings; how then shall I now make a beginning and discuss them? But I rely on two precedents: first, to similar cases our Sages applied the verse,\" It is time to do something in honour of the Lord: for they have made void thy law\" (Ps. 119:126). Secondly, they have said,\" Let all thy acts be guided by pure intentions.\" On these two principles I relied while composing some parts of this work.  ",

                "[Introductory Remarks. ON METHOD.] THERE are seven causes of inconsistencies and contradictions to be met with in a literary work. ",
                "The first cause arises from the fact that the author collects the opinions of various men, each differing from the other, but neglects to mention the name of the author of any particular opinion. In such a work contradictions or inconsistencies must occur, since any two statements may belong to two different authors. ",
                "Second cause: The author holds at first one opinion which he subsequently rejects: in his work, however, both his original and altered views are retained.  ",
                "Third cause: The passages in question are not all to be taken literally: some only are to be understood in their literal sense, while in others figurative language is employed, which includes another meaning besides the literal one: or, in the apparently inconsistent passages, figurative language is employed which, if taken literally, would seem to be contradictions or contraries. ",
                "Fourth cause: The premises are not identical in both statements, but for certain reasons they are not fully stated in these passages: or two propositions with different subjects which are expressed by the same term without having the difference in meaning pointed out, occur in two passages. The contradiction is therefore only apparent, but there is no contradiction in reality. ",

Namely, a difficult and obscure theorem must sometimes be mentioned and assumed as known, for the illustration of some elementary and intelligible subject which must be taught beforehand the commencement being always made with the easier thing. The teacher must therefore facilitate, in any manner which he can devise, the explanation of those theorems, which have to be assumed as known, and he must content himself with giving a general though somewhat inaccurate notion on the subject. It is, for the present, explained according to the capacity of the students, that they may comprehend it as far as they are required to understand the subject.

The larger the number of premises necessary to prove the contradiction between the two conclusions, the greater is the chance that it will escape detection, and that the author will not perceive his own inconsistency. Only when from each conclusion, by means of suitable premises, an inference is made, and from the enunciation thus inferred, by means of proper arguments, other conclusions are formed, and after that process has been repeated many times, then it becomes clear that the original conclusions are contradictions or contraries. Even able writers are liable to overlook such inconsistencies. If, however, the contradiction between the original statements can at once be discovered, and the author, while writing the second, does not think of the first, he evinces a greater deficiency, and his words deserve no notice whatever.

The author must endeavour, by concealing the fact as much as possible, to prevent the uneducated reader from perceiving the contradiction.",

                "Some have been of opinion that by the Hebrew ẓelem, the shape and figure of a thing is to be understood, and this explanation led men to believe in the corporeality [of the Divine Being]: for they thought that the words \"Let us make man in our ẓelem\" (Gen. 1:26), implied that God had the form of a human being, i.e., that He had figure and shape, and that, consequently, He was corporeal. They adhered faithfully to this view, and thought that if they were to relinquish it they would eo ipso reject the truth of the Bible: and further, if they did not conceive God as having a body possessed of face and limbs, similar to their own in appearance, they would have to deny even the existence of God. The sole difference which they admitted, was that He excelled in greatness and splendour, and that His substance was not flesh and blood. Thus far went their conception of the greatness and glory of God. ",
                "The incorporeality of the Divine Being, and His unity, in the true sense of the word--for there is no real unity without incorporeality--will be fully proved in the course of the present treatise. (Guide for the Perplexed 2:1) In this chapter it is our sole intention to explain the meaning of the words ẓelem and demut. I hold that the Hebrew equivalent of \"form\" in the ordinary acceptation of the word, viz., the figure and shape of a thing, is toär. Thus we find \"[And Joseph was] beautiful in toär ('form'), and beautiful in appearance\" (Gen. 39:6): \"What form (toär) is he of?\" (I Sam. 28:14): \"As the form (toär) of the children of a king\" (Judges 8:18). It is also applied to form produced by human labour, as \"He marketh its form (toär) with a line,\" \"and he marketh its form (toär) with the compass\" (Isa. 64:13). This term is not at all applicable to God. ",
                "The term ẓelem, on the other hand, signifies the specific form, viz., that which constitutes the essence of a thing, whereby the thing is what it is; the reality of a thing in so far as it is that particular being. In man the \"form\" is that constituent which gives him human perception: and on account of this intellectual perception the term ẓelem is employed in the sentences \"In the ẓelem of God he created him\" (Gen. 1:27). It is therefore rightly said, \"Thou despisest their ẓelem\" (Ps. 63:20); the \"contempt\" can only concern the soul--the specific form of man, not the properties and shape of his body. I am also of opinion that the reason why this term is used for \"idols\" may be found in the circumstance that they are worshiped on account of some idea represented by them, not on account of their figure and shape. For the same reason the term is used in the expression, \"the forms (ẓalme) of your emerods\" (I Sam. 6:5), for the chief object was the removal of the injury caused by the emerods, not a change of their shape. As, however, it must be admitted that the term ẓelem is employed in these two cases, viz. \"the images of the emerods\" and \"the idols\" on account of the external shape, the term ẓelem is either a homonym or a hybrid term, and would denote both the specific form and the outward shape, and similar properties relating to the dimensions and the shape of material bodies; and in the phrase \"Let us make man in our ẓelem\" (Gen. 1:26), the term signifies \"the specific form\" of man, viz., his intellectual perception, and does not refer to his \"figure\" or \"shape.\" Thus we have shown the difference between ẓelem and toär, and explained the meaning of ẓelem.",
                "Demut is derived from the verb damah, \"he is like.\" This term likewise denotes agreement with regard to some abstract relation: comp. \"I am like a pelican of the wilderness\" (Ps. 102:7); the author does not compare himself to the pelican in point of wings and feathers, but in point of sadness.\" Nor any tree in the garden of God was like unto him in beauty\" (Ezek. 8); the comparison refers to the idea of beauty. \"Their poison is like the poison of a serpent\" (Ps. 58:5); \"He is like unto a lion\" (Ps. 17:12); the resemblance indicated in these passages does not refer to the figure and shape, but to some abstract idea. In the same manner is used \"the likeness of the throne\" (Ezek. 1:26); the comparison is made with regard to greatness and glory, not, as many believe, with regard to its square form, its breadth, or the length of its legs: this explanation applies also to the phrase \"the likeness of the ḥayyot (\"living creatures,\" Ezek. 1:13).",
                "As man's distinction consists in a property which no other creature on earth possesses, viz., intellectual perception, in the exercise of which he does not employ his senses, nor move his hand or his foot, this perception has been compared--though only apparently, not in truth--to the Divine perception, which requires no corporeal organ. On this account, i.e., on account of the Divine intellect with which man has been endowed, he is said to have been made in the form and likeness of the Almighty, but far from it be the notion that the Supreme Being is corporeal, having a material form."

Before, however, entering upon this problem and its solution I must premise that every Hebrew knows that the term Elohim is a homonym, and denotes God, angels, judges, and the rulers of countries, and that Onkelos the proselyte explained it in the true and correct manner by taking Elohim in the sentence, \"and ye shall be like Elohim\" (Gen. 3:5) in the last-mentioned meaning, and rendering the sentence \"and ye shall be like princes.\" Having pointed out the homonymity of the term \"Elohim\" we return to the question under consideration.  ",
                "\"It would at first sight,\" said the objector, \"appear from Scripture that man was originally intended to be perfectly equal to the rest of the animal creation, which is not endowed with intellect, reason, or power of distinguishing between good and evil: but that Adam's disobedience to the command of God procured him that great perfection which is the peculiarity of man, viz., the power of distinguishing between good and evil-the noblest of all the faculties of our nature, the essential characteristic of the human race. It thus appears strange that the punishment for rebelliousness should be the means of elevating man to a pinnacle of perfection to which he had not attained previously. This is equivalent to saying that a certain man was rebellious and extremely wicked, wherefore his nature was changed for the better, and he was made to shine as a star in the heavens.\" Such was the purport and subject of the question, though not in the exact words of the inquirer. ",
                "Now mark our reply, which was as follows:--\"You appear to have studied the matter superficially, and nevertheless you imagine that you can understand a book which has been the guide of past and present generations, when you for a moment withdraw from your lusts and appetites, and glance over its contents as if you were reading a historical work or some poetical composition. Collect your thoughts and examine the matter carefully, for it is not to be understood as you at first sight think, but as you will find after due deliberation; namely, the intellect which was granted to man as the highest endowment, was bestowed on him before his disobedience. With reference to this gift the Bible states that \"man was created in the form and likeness of God.\" On account of this gift of intellect man was addressed by God, and received His commandments, as it is said: \"And the Lord God commanded Adam\" (Gen. 2:16)--for no commandments are given to the brute creation or to those who are devoid of understanding. Through the intellect man distinguishes between the true and the false. This faculty Adam possessed perfectly and completely. The right and the wrong are terms employed in the science of apparent truths (morals), not in that of necessary truths, as, e.g., it is not correct to say, in reference to the proposition \"the heavens are spherical,\" it is \"good\" or to declare the assertion that \"the earth is flat\" to be \"bad\": but we say of the one it is true, of the other it is false. Similarly our language expresses the idea of true and false by the terms emet and sheker, of the morally right and the morally wrong, by tob and ra’. Thus it is the function of the intellect to discriminate between the true and the false--a distinction which is applicable to all objects of intellectual perception. When Adam was yet in a state of innocence, and was guided solely by reflection and reason--on account of which it is said: \"Thou hast made him (man) little lower than the angels\" (Ps. 8:6)--he was not at all able to follow or to understand the principles of apparent truths; the most manifest impropriety, viz., to appear in a state of nudity, was nothing unbecoming according to his idea: he could not comprehend why it should be so. After man's disobedience, however, when he began to give way to desires which had their source in his imagination and to the gratification of his bodily appetites, as it is said, \"And the wife saw that the tree was good for food and delightful to the eyes\" (Gen. 3:6), he was punished by the loss of part of that intellectual faculty which he had previously possessed. He therefore transgressed a command with which he had been charged on the score of his reason; and having obtained a knowledge of the apparent truths, he was wholly absorbed in the study of what is proper and what improper. Then he fully understood the magnitude of the loss he had sustained, what he had forfeited, and in what situation he was thereby placed. Hence we read, \"And ye shall be like elohim, knowing good and evil,\" and not \"knowing\" or \"discerning the true and the false\": while in necessary truths we can only apply the words \"true and false,\" not \"good and evil.\" Further observe the passage, \"And the eyes of both were opened, and they knew they were naked\" (Gen. 3:7): it is not said, \"And the eyes of both were opened, and they saw\"; for what the man had seen previously and what he saw after this circumstance was precisely the same: there had been no blindness which was now removed, but he received a new faculty whereby he found things wrong which previously he had not regarded as wrong. ",
                "Besides, you must know that the Hebrew word pakaḥ used in this passage is exclusively employed in the figurative sense of receiving new sources of knowledge, not in that of regaining the sense of sight. Comp., \"God opened her eyes\" (Gen. 21:19). \"Then shall the eyes of the blind be opened\" (Isaiah 38:8). \"Open ears, he heareth not\" (Isaiah 42:20), similar in sense to the verse, \"Which have eyes to see, and see not\" (Ezek. 12:2). When, however, Scripture says of Adam, \"He changed his face (panav) and thou sentest him forth\" (Job 14:20), it must be understood in the following way: On account of the change of his original aim he was sent away. For panim, the Hebrew equivalent of face, is derived from the verb panah, \"he turned,\" and signifies also \"aim,\" because man generally turns his face towards the thing he desires. In accordance with this interpretation, our text suggests that Adam, as he altered his intention and directed his thoughts to the acquisition of what he was forbidden, he was banished from Paradise: this was his punishment; it was measure for measure. At first he had the privilege of tasting pleasure and happiness, and of enjoying repose and security; but as his appetites grew stronger, and he followed his desires and impulses, (as we have already stated above), and partook of the food he was forbidden to taste, he was deprived of everything, was doomed to subsist on the meanest kind of food, such as he never tasted before, and this even only after exertion and labour, as it is said, \"Thorns and thistles shall grow up for thee\" (Gen. 3:18), \"By the sweat of thy brow,\" etc., and in explanation of this the text continues, \"And the Lord God drove him from the Garden of Eden, to till the ground whence he was taken.\" He was now with respect to food and many other requirements brought to the level of the lower animals: comp., \"Thou shalt eat the grass of the field\" (Gen. 3:18). Reflecting on his condition, the Psalmist says, \"Adam unable to dwell in dignity, was brought to the level of the dumb beast\" (Ps. 49:13).\" May the Almighty be praised, whose design and wisdom cannot be fathomed.\""

Comp. \"the pattern (tabnit) of the Tabernacle and the pattern (tabnit) of all its vessels\" (Exo. 25:9); \"according to the pattern (tabnit) which thou wast shown upon the mount\" (Exo. 25:40); \"the form of any bird\" (Deut. 4:17); \"the form (tabnit) of a hand\" (Ezek. 8:3); \"the pattern (tabnit) of the porch\" (1 Chron. 28:11).

Secondly, the forms of our imagination, i.e., the impressions retained in imagination when the objects have ceased to affect our senses. In this sense it is used in the passage which begins \"In thoughts from the visions of the night\" (Job 4:13), and which concludes \"it remained but I could not recognize its sight, only an image--temunah--was before my eyes,\" i.e., an image which presented itself to my sight during sleep. Thirdly, the true form of an object, which is perceived only by the intellect: and it is in this third signification that the term is applied to God.

All these instances refer to intellectual perception, and by no means to perception with the eye as in its literal meaning: for, on the one hand, the eye can only perceive a corporeal object, and in connection with it certain accidents, as colour, shape, etc.: and, on the other hand, God does not perceive by means of a corporeal organ, as will be explained.",

In this sense the verb is used in passages like the following: \"He hath not beheld (hibbit) iniquity in Jacob\" (Num. 23:21); for \"iniquity\" cannot be seen with the eye. The words, \"And they looked (ve-hibbitu) after Moses\" (Exod. 33:8)--in addition to the literal understanding of the phrase--were explained by our Sages in a figurative sense. According to them, these words mean that the Israelites examined and criticised the actions and sayings of Moses. Compare also \"Contemplate (habbet), I pray thee, the heaven\" (Gen. 15:5); for this took place in a prophetic vision.

We take the same position, and think that a man, when he commences to speculate, ought not to embark at once on a subject so vast and important; he should previously adapt himself to the study of the several branches of science and knowledge, should most thoroughly refine his moral character and subdue his passions and desires, the offspring of his imagination; when, in addition, he has obtained a knowledge of the true fundamental propositions, a comprehension of the several methods of inference and proof, and the capacity of guarding against fallacies, then he may approach the investigation of this subject.

As regards the words, \"the form of Adam, and his likeness,\" we have already stated (Guide for the Perplexed : Part 1 : Chapter 4) their meaning. Those sons of Adam who were born before that time were not human in the true sense of the word, they had not \"the form of man.\" With reference to Seth who had been instructed, enlightened and brought to human perfection, it could rightly be said, \"he (Adam) begat a son in his likeness, in his form.\" It is acknowledged that a man who does not possess this \"form\" (the nature of which has just been explained) is not human, but a mere animal in human shape and form. Yet such a creature has the power of causing harm and injury, a power which does not belong to other creatures. For those gifts of intelligence and judgment with which he has been endowed for the purpose of acquiring perfection, but which he has failed to apply to their proper aim, are used by him for wicked and mischievous ends; he begets evil things, as though he merely resembled man, or simulated his outward appearance. Such was the condition of those sons of Adam who preceded Seth. In reference to this subject the Midrash says: \"During the 130 years when Adam was under rebuke he begat spirits,\" i.e., demons; when, however, he was again restored to divine favour \"he begat in his likeness, in his form.\" This is the sense of the passage, \"Adam lived one hundred and thirty years, and he begat in his likeness, in his form\" (Gen. 5:3)."

In this sense this term, as is well known, is frequently used by authors, e.g., \"He fills his ancestors' place (makom) in point of wisdom and piety\"; \"the dispute still remains in its place\" (makom), i.e., in statu quo [ante]. In the verse, \"Blessed be the glory of the Lord from His place\" (mekomo) (Ezek. 3:12), makom has this figurative meaning, and the verse may be paraphrased \"Blessed be the Lord according to the exalted nature of His existence,\" and wherever makom is applied to God, it expresses the same idea, namely, the distinguished position of His existence, to which nothing is equal or comparable, as will be shown below (Guide for the Perplexed 1:56).",

Since men of greatness and authority, as, e.g., kings, use the throne as a seat, and \"the throne\" thus indicates the rank, dignity, and position of the person for whom it is made, the Sanctuary has been styled \"the throne,\" inasmuch as it likewise indicates the superiority of Him who manifests Himself, and causes His light and glory to dwell therein. Comp. \"A glorious throne on high from the beginning is the place of our sanctuary\" (Jer. 17:12). For the same reason the heavens are called \"throne,\" for to the mind of him who observes them with intelligence they suggest the Omnipotence of the Being which has called them into existence, regulates their motions, and governs the sublunary world by their beneficial influence: as we read, \"Thus saith the Lord, The heavens are my throne and the earth my footstool\" (Isa. 66:1); i.e., they testify to my Existence, my Essence, and my Omnipotence, as the throne testifies to the greatness of him who is worthy to occupy it. This is the idea which true believers should entertain; not, however, that the Omnipotent, Supreme God is supported by any material object; for God is incorporeal, as we shall prove further on; how, then, can He be said to occupy any space, or rest on a body? The fact which I wish to point out is this: every place distinguished by the Almighty, and chosen to receive His light and splendour, as, for instance, the Sanctuary or the Heavens, is termed \"throne\"; ",
                "And, taken in a wider sense, as in the passage \"For my hand is upon the throne of God\" (Exo. 17:16), \"the throne\" denotes here the Essence and Greatness of God. These, however (the Essence and Greatness of God) need not be considered as something separate from the God Himself or as part of the Creation, so that God would appear to have existed both without the throne, and with the throne: such a belief would be undoubtedly heretical. It is distinctly stated, \"Thou, O Lord, remainest for ever; Thy throne from generation to generation\" (Lam. 5:19). By \"Thy throne\" we must, therefore, understand something inseparable from God. On that account, both here and in all similar passages. the word \"throne\" denotes God's Greatness and Essence, which are inseparable from His Being. Our opinion will be further elucidated in the course of this Treatise. "

We shall thus proceed in our treatment of the terms ‘alah and yarad.",
                "These two words, ‘alah, \"he went up,\" and yarad, \"he went down,\" are Hebrew terms used in the sense of ascending and descending. When a body moves from a higher to a lower place, the verb yarad, \"to go down,\" is used; when it moves from a lower to a higher place, ‘alah, \"to go up,\" is applied. These two verbs were afterwards employed with regard to greatness and power. When a man falls from his high position, we say \"he has come down,\" and when he rises in station \"he has gone up.\" Thus the Almighty says, \"The stranger that is within thee shall get up above thee very high, and thou shalt come down very low\" (Deut. 28:43). Again, \"The Lord thy God will set thee on high (‘elyon) above all nations of the earth\" (Deut. 28:1): \"And the Lord magnified Solomon exceedingly\" (lema‘alah) (I Chronicles 29:25). The Sages often employ these expressions, as: \"In holy matters men must ascend (ma‘alin) and not descend (moridin).\" The two words are also applied to intellectual processes, namely, when we reflect on something beneath ourselves we are said to go down, and when our attention is raised to a subject above us we are said to rise.",

When it pleased the Almighty to grant to a human being a certain degree of wisdom or prophetic inspiration, the divine communication thus made to the prophet and the entrance of the Divine Presence into a certain place is termed (yeridah), \"descending,\" while the termination of the prophetic communication or the departure of the divine glory from a place is called ‘aliyah, \"ascending.\" The expressions \"to go up\" and \"to go down,\" when used in reference to God, must be interpreted in this sense. Again, when, in accordance with the divine will, some misfortune befalls a nation or a region of the earth, and when the biblical account of that misfortune is preceded by the statement that the Almighty visited the actions of the people, and that He punished them accordingly, then the prophetic author employs the term \"to descend\": for man is so low and insignificant that his actions would not be visited and would not bring punishment on him, were it not for the divine will:",
                "As is clearly stated in the Bible, with regard to this idea, \"What is man that thou shouldst remember him, and the son of man that thou shouldst visit him\" (Ps. 8:5). The design of the Deity to punish man is, therefore, introduced by the verb \"to descend\": comp. Go to, let us go down and there confound their language\" (Gen. 11:7) \"And the Lord came down to see\" (Gen. 11:5); \"I will go down now and see\" (Gen. 18:21). All these instances convey the idea that man here below is going to be punished. More numerous, however, are the instances of the first case, viz., in which these verbs are used in connection with the revelation of the word and of the glory of God, e.g., \"And I will come down and talk with thee there\" (Num. 11:17); \"And the Lord came down upon Mount Sinai (Exod. 19:20); \"The Lord will come down in the sight of all the people (Exod. 19:11); \"And God went up from him\" (Gen. 35:13); \"And God went up from Abraham\" (Gen. 17:22). When, on the other hand, it says, \"And Moses went up unto God\" (Exod. 19:3), it must be taken in the third signification of these verbs, in addition to its literal meaning that Moses also ascended to the top of the mount, upon which a certain material light (the manifestation of God's glory) was visible; but we must not imagine that the Supreme Being occupies a place to which we can ascend, or from which we can descend. He is far from what the ignorant imagine. "

                "THE primary meaning of the Hebrew yashab is \"he was seated,\" as \"Now Eli the priest sat (yashab) upon a seat\" (I Sam. 1:9); but, since a person can best remain motionless and at rest when sitting, the term was applied to everything that is permanent and unchanging; thus, in the promise that Jerusalem should remain constantly and permanently in an exalted condition, it is stated,\" She will rise and sit in her place\" (Zech. 14:10); further,\" He maketh the woman who was childless to sit as a joyful mother of children\" (Ps. 113:9); i.e., He makes her happy condition to be permanent and enduring. When applied to God, the verb is to be taken in that latter sense: \"Thou O Lord, remainest (tesheb) for ever\" (Lam. 5:19); \"O thou who sittest (ha-yoshebi) in the heavens\" (Ps. 123:1); \"He who sitteth in the heavens\" (Ps. 2:4), i.e., He who is everlasting, constant, and in no way subject to change; immutable in His Essence, and as He consists of nought but His Essence, He is mutable in no way whatever; not mutable in His relation to other things: for there is no relation whatever existing between Him and any other being, as will be explained below, and therefore no change as regard; such relations can take place in Him. Hence He is immutable in every respect, as He expressly declares, \"I, the Lord, do not change\" (Mal. 3:6); i.e., in Me there is not any change whatever. This idea is expressed by the term yashab when referring to God.",

The verb is also employed in descriptions of God's relation (the term \"relation\" is here used as a homonym) to existing species of evanescent things: for those species are as constant, well organized, and unvarying as the individuals of the heavenly hosts. Thus we find, \"Who sitteth over the circle of the earth\" (Isa. 40:22), Who remains constantly and unremittingly over the sphere of the earth; that is to say, over the things that come into existence within that sphere. Again, \"The Lord sitteth upon the flood\" (Ps. 29:10), i.e., despite the change and variation of earthly objects, no change takes place with respect to God's relation (to the earth): His relation to each of the things which come into existence and perish again is stable and constant, for it concerns only the existing species and not the individuals.

An instance of karab being used in this meaning is contained in the following passage, \"And the cause that is too hard for you, bring (takribun) it unto me\" (Deut. i. 17); this is equivalent to saying, \"Ye shall make it known unto me.\" The verb karab (in the Hiphil) is thus employed in the sense of giving information concerning a thing.

In this sense it is said \"The whole earth is full (melo) of his glory\" (Isa. vi. 4), \"All the earth gives evidence of his perfection,\" i.e. leads to a knowledge of it.

If, on the other hand, you prefer to think that in this passage by \"the glory of the Lord,\" a certain light created for the purpose is to be understood, that such light is always termed \"glory,\" and that such light \"filled the tabernacle,\" we have no objection."

In the former sense it occurs in \"And they lifted up (va-yisseü) their corn upon their asses\" (Gen. xlii. 26) and there are many instances like this in which this verb has the meaning \"to carry,\" \"to move\" from place to place: for this implies elevation in space.

                "IN its primary signification the Hebrew ‘abar, \"to pass,\" refers to the motion of a body in space, and is chiefly applied to living creatures moving at some distance in a straight line, e.g., \"And He passed over (‘abar) before them\" (Gen. xxxiii. 3); \"Pass (‘abor) before the people\" (Exod. xvii. 5). Instances of this kind are numerous. The verb was next applied to the passage of sound through air, as \"And they caused a sound to pass (va-ya‘abiru) through out the camp\" (Exod. xxxvi. 6); \"That I hear the Lord's people spreading the report\" (ma‘abirim) (1 Sam. ii. 24).",

This took place in a prophetic vision, for the narrative commences, \"And a deep sleep fell upon Abram.\" The verb has this latter meaning in Exodus xii. 12, \"And I shall pass (ve-‘abarti) through the land of Egypt\" (denoting \"I shall reveal myself,\" etc.), and in all similar phrases.",
                "The verb is next employed to express that a person has gone too far, and transgressed the usual limit, in the performance of some act, as \"And as a man who is drinking wine has passed (‘abarv) the proper limit\" (Jer. xxiii. 9).",

This is the sense, it appears to me, of this verb in \"And the Lord passed by (va-ya‘abor) before his face\" (Exod. xxxiv. 6). I take \"his face\" to mean \"the face of God\"; our Teachers likewise interpreted \"his face\" as being identical with \"the face of God.\" And, although this is found in the midst of Agadic interpretations which would be out of place in this our work, yet it is some support of our view, that the pronoun \"his\" is employed in this passage as a substitute for \"God's\"--and the whole passage could in my opinion be explained as follows: Moses sought to attain to a certain perception which is called \"the perception of the Divine face,\" a term occurring in the phrase \"My face cannot be seen\"; but God vouchsafed to him a perception of a lower degree, viz., the one called, \"the seeing of the back,\" in the words, \"And thou shalt see my back\" (Exod. xxxiii. 23). We have mentioned this subject in our work Mishneh Torah. Accordingly, it is stated in the above-mentioned passage that the Lord withheld from Moses that perception which is termed \"the seeing of the Divine face,\" and substituted for it another gift, viz., the knowledge of the acts attributed to God, which, as I shall explain (chap. liv.) are considered to be different and separate attributes of the Supreme. In asserting that God withheld from Moses (the higher knowledge) I mean to say that this knowledge was unattainable, that by its nature it was inaccessible to Moses; for man, whilst able to gain perfection by applying his reasoning faculties to the attainment of what is within the reach of his intellect, either weakens his reason or loses it altogether as soon as he ventures to seek a higher degree of knowledge--as I shall elucidate in one of the chapters of this work--unless he be granted a special aid from heaven, as is described in the words, \"And I will cover thee with my hand until I pass by\" (Exod. xxxiii. 23)",
                "Onkelos, in translating this verse, adopts the same method which he applies to the explanation of similar passages, viz., every expression implying corporeality or corporal properties, when referring to God, he explains by assuming an ellipsis of a nomen regens before \"God,\" thus connecting the expression (of corporeality) with another word which is supplied, and which governs the genitive \"God\": e.g., \"And behold the Lord stood upon it\" (Gen. xxviii. 13), he explains, \"The glory of the Lord stood arrayed above it.\" Again, \"The Lord watch between me and thee\" (Gen. xxxi. 49), he paraphrases, \"The word of the Lord shall watch.\" This is his ordinary method in explaining Scripture. He applies it also to Exod. xxxiv. 6, which he paraphrases, \"The Lord caused his Presence to pass before his face and called.\" According to this rendering the thing which passed was unquestionably some physical object, the pronoun \"his\" refers to Moses, and the phrase ‘al panav is identical with lefanav, \"before him.\" Comp. \"So went the present over before him\" (‘al panav) (Gen. xxxii. 22). This is likewise an appropriate and satisfactory explanation: and I can adduce still further support for the opinion of Onkelos from the words \"while my glory passeth by\" (ba-‘abor) (Exod. xxxiii. 22), which expressly state that the passing object was something ascribed to God, not God Himself: and of this Divine glory it is also said, \"until I pass by,\" and \"And the Lord passed by before him.\"",
                "Should it, however, be considered necessary to assume here an ellipsis, according to the method of Onkelos, who supplies in some instances the term \"the Glory,\" in others \"the Word,\" and in others \"the Divine Presence,\" as the context may require in each particular case, we may also supply here the word \"voice,\" and explain the passage, \"And a voice from the Lord passed before him and called.\" We have already shown that the verb ‘abar, \"he passed,\" can be applied to the voice, as in \"And they caused a voice to pass through the camp\" (Exod. xxxvi. 6). According to this explanation, it was the voice which called. No objection can be raised to applying the verb kara (he called) to kol (voice), for a similar phrase occurs in the Bible in reference to God's commands to Moses, \"He heard the voice speaking unto him\"; and, in the same manner as it can be said \"the voice spoke,\" we may also say \"the voice called\"; indeed, we can even support this application of the verbs \"to say, \"and \"to call,\" to \"the voice,\" by parallel passages, as \"A voice saith 'Cry,' and it says 'What shall I cry?'\" (Isa. xl. 6). According to this view, the meaning of the passage under discussion would be: \"A voice of God passed before him and called, 'Eternal, Eternal, All-powerful, All-merciful, and All-gracious!'\" (The word Eternal is repeated; it is in the vocative, for the Eternal is the one who is called.

Either explanation may be adopted: you may take that grand scene altogether as a prophetic vision, and the whole occurrence as a mental operation, and consider that what Moses sought, what was withheld from him, and what he attained, were things perceived by the intellect without the use of the senses (as we have explained above): or you may assume that in addition there was a certain ocular perception of a material object, the sight of which would assist intellectual perception. The latter is the view of Onkelos, unless he assumes that in this instance the ocular perception was likewise a prophetic vision, as was the case with \"a smoking furnace and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces\" (Gen. xv. 17), mentioned in the history of Abraham. You may also assume that in addition there was a perception of sound, and that there was a voice which passed before him, and was undoubtedly something material. You may choose either of these opinions, for our sole intention and purpose is to guard you against the belief that the phrase \"and the Lord passed,\" is analogous to \"pass before the people\" (Exod. xvii. 5), for God, being incorporeal, cannot be said to move, and consequently the verb \"to pass\" cannot with propriety be applied to Him in its primary signification."

The term was also employed metaphorically in the sense of \"to come\" applied to a certain event, that is, to something incorporeal, as \"When thy sayings come to pass (yabo)\" (Judg. xiii. 17); \"Of that which will come (yaboü) over thee\" (Isa. xlvii. 13). Nay, it is even applied to privatives, e.g., \"Yet evil came (va-yabo)\" (Job iii. 26); \"And darkness came (va-yabo)\" Now, since the word has been applied to incorporeal things, it has also been used in reference to God-to the fulfilment of His word, or to the manifestation of His Presence (the Shechinah). In this figurative sense it is said, \"Lo, I come (ba) unto thee in a thick cloud\" (Exod. xix. 9); \"For the Lord the God of Israel cometh (ba) through it\" (Ezek. xliv. 2). In these and all similar passages, the coming of the Shechinah is meant, but the words, \"And the Lord my God shall come (u-ba)\" (Zech. xiv. 5) are identical with \"His word will come,\" that is to say, the promises which He made through the Prophets will be fulfilled; therefore Scripture adds \"all the holy ones that are with thee,\" that is to say, \"The word of the Lord my God will be performed, which has been spoken by all the holy ones who are with thee, who address the Israelites.\""

Comp. \"By the word of the Lord were the heavens made, and all the host of them by the breath of his mouth\" (Ps. xxxiii. 6).

Thus the Prophet foretelling misfortune says, \"And I will hide my face from them, and they shall be devoured\" (Deut. xxxi. 17); for, when man is deprived of Divine protection he is exposed to all dangers, and becomes the butt of all fortuitous circumstances: his fortune and misfortune then depend on chance.

Seeing that the whole narrative is introduced as a vision of the night, Onkelos did not hesitate to translate literally the words addressed to Jacob in the nocturnal vision, and thus gave a faithful account of the occurrence. For the passage in question contains a statement of what Jacob was told, not what actually took place, as is the case in the words, \"And the Lord came down upon Mount Sinai\" (Exod. xix. 20). Here we have an account of what actually occurred in the physical world; the verb yarad is therefore paraphrased \"He manifested Himself,\" and entirely detached from the idea of motion.

Thus Jacob says, \"And the angel of God spake unto me in a dream, saying, Jacob.

It is the usual practice of prophets to relate words addressed to them by an angel in the name of God, as though God Himself had spoken to them.

For he does not say, \"and under His throne\"; the direct relation of the throne to God, implied in the literal sense of the phrase \"His throne,\" would necessarily suggest the idea that God is supported by a material object, and thus lead directly to the corporeality of God: he therefore refers the throne to His glory, i.e., to the Shekhinah, which is a light created for the purpose.",
                "Similarly he paraphrases the words, \"For my hand I lift up to the throne of God\" (Exod. xvii. 16), \"An oath has been uttered by God, whose Shekhinah is upon the throne of his glory.\" This principle found also expression in the popular phrase, \"the Throne of the Glory.\"",
                "We have already gone too far away from the subject of this chapter, and touched upon things which will be discussed in other chapters; we will now return to our present theme. You are acquainted with the version of Onkelos [of the passage quoted]. He contents himself with excluding from his version all expressions of corporeality in reference to God, and does not show us what they (the nobles of the children of Israel Exod. xxiv. 10) perceived, or what is meant by that figure. In all similar instances Onkelos also abstains from entering into such questions, and only endeavours to exclude every expression implying corporeality; for the incorporeality of God is a demonstrative truth and an indispensable element in our faith; he could decidedly state all that was necessary in that respect. The interpretation of a simile is a doubtful thing: it may possibly have that meaning, but it may also refer to something else. It contains besides very profound matter, the understanding of which is not a fundamental element in our faith, and the comprehension of which is not easy for the common people. Onkelos, therefore, did not enter at all into this subject.",
                "We, however, remaining faithful to our task in this treatise, find ourselves compelled to give our explanation. According to our opinion \"under his feet\" (raglav) denotes \"under that of which He is the cause,\" \"that which exists through Him,\" as we have already stated. They (the nobles of the children of Israel) therefore comprehended the real nature of the materia prima, which emanated from Him, and of whose existence He is the only cause. Consider well the phrase, \"like the action of the whiteness of the sapphire stone.\" If the colour were the point of comparison, the words, \"as the whiteness of the sapphire stone\" would have sufficed; but the addition of \"like the action\" was necessary, because matter, as such, is, as you are well aware, always receptive and passive, active only by some accident. On the other hand, form, as such, is always active, and only passive by some accident, as is explained in works on Physics. This explains the addition of \"like the action\" in reference to the materia prima. The expression \"the whiteness of the sapphire\" refers to the transparency, not to the white colour: for \"the whiteness\" of the sapphire is not a white colour, but the property of being transparent. Things, however, which are transparent, have no colour of their own, as is proved in works on Physics: for if they had a colour they would not permit all the colours to pass through them nor would they receive colours: it is only when the transparent object is totally colourless, that it is able to receive successively all the colours. In this respect it (the whiteness of the sapphire) is like the materia prima, which as such is entirely formless, and thus receives all the forms one after the other. What they (the nobles of the children of Israel) perceived was therefore the materia prima, whose relation to God is distinctly mentioned, because it is the source of those of his creatures which are subject to genesis and destruction, and has been created by him. This subject also will be treated later on more fully.",
                "Observe that you must have recourse to an explanation of this kind, even when adopting the rendering of Onkelos, \"And under the throne of His glory\"; for in fact the materia prima is also under the heavens, which are called \"throne of God,\" as we have remarked above. I should not have thought of this unusual interpretation, or hit on this argument were it not for an utterance of R. Eliezer ben Hyrcanus, which will be discussed in one of the parts of this treatise (II. chap. xxvi.). The primary object of every intelligent person must be to deny the corporeality of God, and to believe that all those perceptions (described in the above passage) were of a spiritual not of a material character. Note this and consider it well."

With regard to man, we use the expression \"he said to himself,\" or \"he said in his heart,\" in reference to a subject which he did not utter or communicate to any other person. Similarly the phrase \"And God said in his heart,\" is used in reference to an act which God decreed without mentioning it to any prophet at the time the event took place according to the will of God. And a figure of this kind is admissible, since \"the Torah speaketh in accordance with the language of man\" (supra c. xxvi.). This is plain and clear. In the Pentateuch no distinct mention is made of a message sent to the wicked generation of the flood, cautioning or threatening them with death; therefore, it is said concerning them, that God was angry with them in His heart; likewise when He decreed that no flood should happen again, He did not tell a prophet to communicate it to others, and for that reason the words \"in his heart\" are added.",
                "Taking the verb in the third signification, we explain the passage thus: \"And man rebelled against God's will concerning him\"; for leb (heart) also signifies \"will,\" as we shall explain when treating of the homonymity of leb (heart)."

                "THERE are four different theories concerning Divine Providence; they are all ancient, known since the time of the Prophets, when the true Law was revealed to enlighten these dark regions. First Theory.--There is no Providence at all for anything in the Universe; all parts of the Universe, the heavens and what they contain, owe their origin to accident and chance; there exists no being that rules and governs them or provides for them. This is the theory of Epicurus, who assumes also that the Universe consists of atoms, that these have combined by chance, and have received their various forms by mere accident. There have been atheists among the Israelites who have expressed the same view; it is reported of them: \"They have denied the Lord, and said he is not\" (Jer. v. 12). Aristotle has proved the absurdity of the theory, that the whole Universe could have originated by chance; he has shown that, on the contrary, there is a being that rules and governs the Universe. We have already touched upon this subject in the present treatise. Second Theory.--Whilst one part of the Universe owes its existence to Providence, and is under the control of a ruler and governor, another part is abandoned and left to chance. This is the view of Aristotle about Providence, and I will now explain to you his theory. He holds that God controls the spheres and what they contain: therefore the individual beings in the spheres remain permanently in the same form. Alexander has also expressed it in his writings that Divine Providence extends down to, and ends with, the sphere of the moon. This view results from his theory of the Eternity of the Universe; he believes that Providence is in accordance with the nature of the Universe: consequently in the case of the spheres with their contents, where each individual being has a permanent existence, Providence gives permanency and constancy. From the existence of the spheres other beings derive existence, which are constant in their species but not in their individuals: in the same manner it is said that Providence sends forth [from the spheres to the earth] sufficient influence to secure the immortality and constancy of the species, without securing at the same time permanence for the individual beings of the species. But the individual beings in each species have not been entirely abandoned, that portion of the materia prima which has been purified and refined, and has received the faculty of growth, is endowed with properties that enable it to exist a certain time, to attract what is useful and to repel what is useless. That portion of the materia prima which has been subject to a further development, and has received the faculty of sensation, is endowed with other properties for its protection and preservation; it has a new faculty of moving freely toward that which is conducive to, and away from that which is contrary to its well-being. Each individual being received besides such properties as are required for the preservation of the species to which it belongs. The portion of the materia prima which is still more refined, and is endowed with the intellectual faculty, possesses a special property by which each individual, according to the degree of his perfection, is enabled to manage, to calculate, and to discover what is conducive both to the temporary existence of the individual and to the preservation of the species. All other movements, however, which are made by the individual members of each species are due to accident; they are not, according to Aristotle, the result of rule and management; e.g., when a storm or gale blows, it causes undoubtedly some leaves of a tree to drop, breaks off some branches of another tree, tears away a stone from a heap of stones, raises dust over herbs and spoils them, and stirs up the sea so that a ship goes down with the whole or part of her contents. Aristotle sees no difference between the falling of a leaf or a stone and the death of the good and noble people in the ship; nor does he distinguish between the destruction of a multitude of ants caused by an ox depositing on them his excrement and the death of worshippers killed by the fall of the house when its foundations give way; nor does he discriminate between the case of a cat killing a mouse that happens to come in her way, or that of a spider catching a fly, and that of a hungry lion meeting a prophet and tearing him. In short, the opinion of Aristotle is this: Everything is the result of management which is constant, which does not come to an end and does not change any of its properties, as e.g., the heavenly beings, and everything which continues according to a certain rule, and deviates from it only rarely and exceptionally, as is the case in objects of Nature. All these are the result of management, i.e., in a close relation to Divine Providence. But that which is not constant, and does not follow a certain rule, as e.g., incidents in the existence of the individual beings in each species of plants or animals, whether rational or irrational, is due to chance and not to management; it is in no relation to Divine Providence. Aristotle holds that it is even impossible to ascribe to Providence the management of these things. This view is closely connected with his theory of the Eternity, of the Universe, and with his opinion that everything different from the existing order of things in Nature is impossible. It is the belief of those who turned away from our Law, and said: \"God hath forsaken the earth\" (Ezek. ix. 9). Third Theory.--This theory is the reverse of the second. According to this theory, there is nothing in the whole Universe, neither a class nor an individual being, that is due to chance; everything is the result of will, intention, and rule. It is a matter of course that he who rules must know [that which is under his control]. The Mohammedan Ashariyah adhere to this theory, notwithstanding evident absurdities implied in it; for they admit that Aristotle is correct in assuming one and the same cause [viz., the wind] for the fall of leaves [from the tree] and for the death of a man [drowned in the sea]. But they hold at the same time that the wind did not blow by chance; it is God that caused it to move; it is not therefore the wind that caused the leaves to fall; each leaf falls according to the Divine decree; it is God who caused it to fall at a certain time and in a certain place; it could not have fallen before or after that time or in another place, as this has previously been decreed. The Ashariyah were therefore compelled to assume that motion and rest of living beings are predestined, and that it is not in the power of man to do a certain thing or to leave it undone. The theory further implies a denial of possibility in these things: they can only be either necessary or impossible. The followers of this theory accepted also the last-mentioned proposition, and say, that we call certain things possible, as e.g., the facts that Zeid stands, and that Amr is coming; but they are only possible for us, whilst in their relation to God they cannot be called possible; they are either necessary or impossible. It follows also from this theory, that precepts are perfectly useless, since the people to whom any law is given are unable to do anything: they can neither do what they are commanded nor abstain from what they are forbidden. The supporters of this theory hold that it was the will of God to send prophets, to command, to forbid, to promise, and to threaten, although we have no power [over our actions]. A duty would thus be imposed upon us which is impossible for us to carry out, and it is even possible that we may suffer punishment when obeying the command and receive reward when disobeying it. According to this theory, it must also be assumed that the actions of God have no final cause. All these absurdities are admitted by the Ashariyah for the purpose of saving this theory. When we see a person born blind or leprous, who could not have merited a punishment for previous sins, they say, It is the will of God; when a pious worshipper is tortured and slain, it is likewise the will of God; and no injustice can be asserted to Him for that, for according to their opinion it is proper that God should afflict the innocent and do good to the sinner. Their views on these matters are well known. Fourth Theory.--Man has free will; it is therefore intelligible that the Law contains commands and prohibitions, with announcements of reward and punishment. All acts of God are due to wisdom; no injustice is found in Him, and He does not afflict the good. The Mu’tazila profess this theory, although they do not believe in man's absolute free will. They hold also that God takes notice of the falling of the leaf and the destruction of the ant, and that His Providence extends over all things. This theory likewise implies contradictions and absurdities. The absurdities are these: The fact that some persons are born with defects, although they have not sinned previously, is ascribed to the wisdom of God, it being better for those persons to be in such a condition than to be in a normal state, though we do not see why it is better; and they do not suffer thereby any punishment at all, but, on the contrary, enjoy God's goodness. In a similar manner the slaughter of the pious is explained as being for them the source of an increase of reward in future life. They go even further in their absurdities. We ask them why is God only just to man and not to other beings, and how has the irrational animal sinned, that it is condemned to be slaughtered? and they reply it is good for the animal, for it will receive reward for it in the world to come; also the flea and the louse will there receive compensation for their untimely death: the same reasoning they apply to the mouse torn by a cat or vulture; the wisdom of God decreed this for the mouse, in order to reward it after death for the mishap. I do not consider it proper to blame the followers of any of the [last named] three theories on Providence, for they have been driven to accept them by weighty considerations. Aristotle was guided by that which appears to be the nature of things. The Ashariyah refused to ascribe to God ignorance about anything, and to say that God whilst knowing one individual being or one portion of the Universe is ignorant of another portion; they preferred to admit the above-mentioned absurdities. The Mu’tazilites refused to assume that God does what is wrong and unjust; on the other hand, they would not contradict common sense and say that it was not wrong to inflict pain on the guiltless, or that the mission of the Prophets and the giving of the Law had no intelligible reason. They likewise preferred to admit the above-named absurdities. But they even contradicted themselves, because they believe on the one hand that God knows everything, and on the other that man has free win. By a little consideration we discover the contradiction. Fifth Theory.--This is our theory, or that of our Law. I will show you [first] the view expressed on this subject in our prophetical books, and generally accepted by our Sages. I will then give the opinion of some later authors among us, and lastly, I will explain my own belief. The theory of man's perfectly free will is one of the fundamental principles of the Law of our Teacher Moses, and of those who follow the Law. According to this principle man does what is in his power to do, by his nature, his choice, and his will; and his action is not due to any faculty created for the purpose. All species of irrational animals likewise move by their own free will. This is the Will of God; that is to say, it is due to the eternal divine will that all living beings should move freely, and that man should have power to act according to his will or choice within the limits of his capacity. Against this principle we hear, thank God, no opposition on the part of our nation. Another fundamental principle taught by the Law of Moses is this: Wrong cannot be ascribed to God in any way whatever; all evils and afflictions as well as all kinds of happiness of man, whether they concern one individual person or a community, are distributed according to justice; they are the result of strict judgment that admits no wrong whatever. Even when a person suffers pain in consequence of a thorn having entered into his hand, although it is at once drawn out, it is a punishment that has been inflicted on him [for sin], and the least pleasure he enjoys is a reward [for some good action]; all this is meted out by strict justice; as is said in Scripture, \"all his ways are judgment\" (Deut. xxxii. 4); we are only ignorant of the working of that judgment. The different theories are now fully explained to you; everything in the varying human affairs is due to chance, according to Aristotle, to the Divine Will alone according to the Ashariyah, to Divine Wisdom according to the Mu’tazilites, to the merits of man according to our opinion. It is therefore possible, according to the Ashariyah, that God inflicts pain on a good and pious man in this world, and keeps him for ever in fire, which is assumed to rage in the world to come, they simply say it is the Will of God. The Mu’tazilites would consider this as injustice, and therefore assume that every being, even an ant, that is stricken with pain [in this world], has compensation for it, as has been mentioned above; and it is due to God's Wisdom that a being is struck and afflicted in order to receive compensation. We, however, believe that all these human affairs are managed with justice; far be it from God to do wrong, to punish any one unless the punishment is necessary and merited. It is distinctly stated in the Law, that all is done in accordance with justice; and the words of our Sages generally express the same idea. They clearly say: \"There is no death without sin, no sufferings without transgression.\" (B. T. Shabbath, 55a.) Again, \"The deserts of an are meted out to him in the same measure which he himself employs.\" (Mish. Sotah, i. 7.) These are the words of the Mishnah. Our Sages declare it wherever opportunity is given, that the idea of God necessarily implies justice; that He will reward the most pious for all their pure and upright actions, although no direct commandment was given them through a prophet; and that He will punish all the evil deeds of men, although they have not been prohibited by a prophet, if common sense warns against them, as e.g., injustice and violence. Thus our Sages say: \"God does not deprive any being of the full reward [of its good deed]\" (B. T. Pes. 118a) again, \"He who says that God remits part of a punishment;, will be punished severely; He is long-suffering, but is sure to exact payment.\" (B. T. Baba K. 50a.) Another saying is this: \"He who has received a commandment and acts accordingly is not like him who acts in the same manner without being commanded to do so\" (B. T. Kidd. 31a); and it is distinctly added that he who does a good thing without being commanded, receives nevertheless his reward. The same principle is expressed in all sayings of our Sages. But they contain an additional doctrine which is not found in the Law; viz., the doctrine of \"afflictions of love,\" as taught by some of our Sages. According to this doctrine it is possible that a person be afflicted without having previously committed any sin, in order that his future reward may be increased; a view which is held by the Mu’tazilites, but is not supported by any Scriptural text. Be not misled by the accounts of trials, such as \"God tried Abraham\" (Gen. xxii. 1); \"He afflicted thee and made thee hungry,\" etc. (Deut. viii. 3); for you will hear more on this subject later on (chap. xxiv.). Our Law is only concerned with the relations of men; but the idea that irrational living beings should receive a reward, has never before been heard of in our nation: the wise men mentioned in the Talmud do not notice it; only some of the later Geonim were pleased with it when they heard it from the sect of the Mu’tazilites, and accepted it. My opinion on this principle of Divine Providence I will now explain to you. In the principle which I now proceed to expound I do not rely on demonstrative proof, but on my conception of the spirit of the Divine Law, and the writings of the Prophets. The principle which I accept is far less open to objections, and is more reasonable than the opinions mentioned before. It is this: In the lower or sublunary portion of the Universe Divine Providence does not extend to the individual members of species except in the case of mankind. It is only in this species that the incidents in the existence of the individual beings, their good and evil fortunes, are the result of justice, in accordance with the words, \"For all His ways are judgment.\" But I agree with Aristotle as regards all other living beings, and à fortiori as regards plants and all the rest of earthly creatures. For I do not believe that it is through the interference of Divine Providence that a certain leaf drops [from a tree], nor do I hold that when a certain spider catches a certain fly, that this is the direct result of a special decree and will of God in that moment; it is not by a particular Divine decree that the spittle of a certain person moved, fell on a certain gnat in a certain place, and killed it; nor is it by the direct will of God that a certain fish catches and swallows a certain worm on the surface of the water. In all these cases the action is, according to my opinion, entirely due to chance, as taught by Aristotle. Divine Providence is connected with Divine intellectual influence, and the same beings which are benefited by the latter so as to become intellectual, and to comprehend things comprehensible to rational beings, are also under the control of Divine Providence, which examines all their deeds in order to reward or punish them. It may be by mere chance that a ship goes down with all her contents, as in the above-mentioned instance, or the roof of a house falls upon those within; but it is not due to chance, according to our view, that in the one instance the men went into the ship, or remained in the house in the other instance: it is due to the will of God, and is in accordance with the justice of His judgments, the method of which our mind is incapable of understanding. I have been induced to accept this theory by the circumstance that I have not met in any of the prophetical books with a description of God's Providence otherwise than in relation to human beings. The prophets even express their surprise that God should take notice of man, who is too little and too unimportant to be worthy of the attention of the Creator: how, then, should other living creatures be considered as proper objects for Divine Providence! Comp. \"What is man, that thou takest knowledge of him?\" (Ps. cxliv. 3); \"What is man, that thou art mindful of him?\" (ibid. viii. 8). It is clearly expressed in many Scriptural passages that God provides for all men, and controls all their deeds--e.g., \"He fashioneth their hearts alike, he considereth all their works\" (ibid. xxxiii. 15); \"For thine eyes are open upon all the ways of the sons of men, to give every one according to his ways\" (Jer. xxxii. 19). Again: \"For his eyes are upon the ways of man, and he seeth all his goings\" (Job xxxii. 21). In the Law there occur instances of the fact that men are governed by God, and that their actions are examined by him. Comp. \"In the day when I visit I will visit their sin upon them\" (Exod. xxxii. 34) \"I will even appoint over you terror\" (Lev. xxvi. 16); \"Whosoever hath sinned against me, him will I blot out of my book\" (Exod. xxxii. 33); \"The same soul will I destroy\" (Lev. xxiii. 30); \"I will even set my face against that soul\" (ibid. xx. 6). There are many instances of this kind. All that is mentioned of the history of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob is a perfect proof that Divine Providence extends. to every man individually. But the condition of the individual beings of other living creatures is undoubtedly the same as has been stated by Aristotle. On that account it is allowed, even commanded, to kill animals; we are permitted to use them according to our pleasure. The view that other living beings are only governed by Divine Providence in the way described by Aristotle, is supported by the words of the Prophet Habakkuk. When he perceived the victories of Nebuchadnezzar, and saw the multitude of those slain by him, he said, \"O God, it is as if men were abandoned, neglected, and unprotected like fish and like worms of the earth.\" He thus shows that these classes are abandoned. This is expressed in the following passage: \"And makest men as the fishes of the sea, as the creeping things, that have no ruler over them. They take up all of them with the angle,\" etc. (Hab. i. 14, 15). The prophet then declares that such is not the case; for the events referred to are not the result of abandonment, forsaking, and absence of Providence, but are intended as a punishment for the people, who well deserved all that befell them. He therefore says: \"O Lord, Thou hast ordained them for judgment, and O mighty God, Thou hast established them for correction\" (ibid. ver. 12). Our opinion is not contradicted by Scriptural passages like the following: \"He giveth to the beast his food\" (Ps. cxlvii. 9); \"The young lions roar after their prey, and seek their meat from God\" (ibid. civ. 2 1);\" Thou openest thine hand, and satisfiest the desire of every living thing\" (ibid. cxlv. 16); or by the saying of our Sages: \"He sitteth and feedeth all, from the horns of the unicorns even unto the eggs of insects.\" There are many similar sayings extant in the writings of our Sages, but they imply nothing that is contrary to my view. All these passages refer to Providence in relation to species, and not to Providence in relation to individual animals. The acts of God are as it were enumerated; how He provides for every species the necessary food and the means of subsistence. This is clear and plain. Aristotle likewise holds that this kind of Providence is necessary, and is in actual existence. Alexander also notices this fact in the name of Aristotle, viz., that every species has its nourishment prepared for its individual members; otherwise the species would undoubtedly have perished. It does not require much consideration to understand this. There is a rule laid down by our Sages that it is directly prohibited in the Law to cause pain to an animal, and is based on the words: \"Wherefore hast thou smitten thine ass?\" etc. (Num. xxii. 32). But the object of this rule is to make us perfect; that we should not assume cruel habits: and that we should not uselessly cause pain to others: that, on the contrary, we should be prepared to show pity and mercy to all living creatures, except when necessity demands the contrary: \"When thy soul longeth to eat flesh,\" etc. (Deut. Xii. 20). We should not kill animals for the purpose of practising cruelty, or for the purpose of play. It cannot be objected to this theory, Why should God select mankind as the object of His special Providence, and not other living beings? For he who asks this question must also inquire, Why has man alone, of all species of animals, been endowed with intellect? The answer to this second question must be, according to the three afore-mentioned theories: It was the Will of God, it is the decree of His Wisdom, or it is in accordance with the laws of Nature. The same answers apply to the first question. Understand thoroughly my theory, that I do not ascribe to God ignorance of anything or any kind of weakness; I hold that Divine Providence is related and closely connected with the intellect, because Providence can only proceed from an intelligent being, from a being that is itself the most perfect Intellect. Those creatures, therefore, which receive part of that intellectual influence. will become subject to the action of Providence in the same proportion as they are acted upon by the Intellect. This theory is in accordance with reason and with the teaching of Scripture, whilst the other theories previously mentioned either exaggerate Divine Providence or detract from it. In the former case they lead to confusion and entire nonsense, and cause us to deny reason and to contradict that which is perceived with the senses. The latter case, viz., the theory that Divine Providence does not extend to man, and that there is no difference between man and other animals, implies very bad notions about God; it disturbs all social order, removes and destroys all the moral and intellectual virtues of man."

                "THERE is a great difference between the knowledge which the producer of a thing possesses concerning it, and the knowledge which other persons possess concerning the same thing. Suppose a thing is produced in accordance with the knowledge of the producer, the producer was then guided by his knowledge in the act of producing the thing. Other people, however, who examine this work and acquire a knowledge of the whole of it, depend for that knowledge on the work itself. E.g., An artisan makes a box in which weights move with the running of the water, and thus indicate how many hours have passed of the day and of the night. The whole quantity of the water that is to run out, the different ways in which it runs, every thread that is drawn, and every little ball that descends--all this is fully perceived by him who makes the clock; and his knowledge is not the result of observing the movements as they are actually going on; but, on the contrary, the movements are produced in accordance with his knowledge. But another person who looks at that instrument will receive fresh knowledge at every movement he perceives; the longer he looks on, the more knowledge does he acquire; he will gradually increase his knowledge till he fully understands the machinery. If an infinite number of movements were assumed for this instrument, he would never be able to complete his knowledge. Besides, he cannot know any of the movements before they take place, since he only knows them from their actual occurrence. ",
                "The same is the case with every object, and its relation to our knowledge and God's knowledge of it. Whatever we know of the things is derived from observation: on that account it is impossible for us to know that which will take place in future, or that which is infinite. Our knowledge is acquired and increased in proportion to the things known by us. This is not the case with God. His knowledge of things is not derived from the things themselves: if this were the case, there would be change and plurality in His knowledge; on the contrary, the things are in accordance with His eternal knowledge, which has established their actual properties, and made part of them purely spiritual, another part material and constant as regards its individual members, a third part material and changeable as regards the individual beings according to eternal and constant laws. Plurality, acquisition, and change in His knowledge is therefore impossible. He fully knows His unchangeable essence, and has thus a knowledge of all that results from any of His acts. If we were to try to understand in what manner this is done, it would be the same as if we tried to be the same as God, and to make our knowledge identical with His knowledge. Those who seek the truth, and admit what is true, must believe that nothing is hidden from God; that everything is revealed to His knowledge, which is identical with His essence; that this kind of knowledge cannot be comprehended by us; for if we knew its method, we would possess that intellect by which such knowledge could be acquired. Such intellect does not exist except in God, and is at the same time His essence. Note this well, for I think that this is an excellent idea, and leads to correct views: no error will be found in it; no dialectical argument; it does not lead to any absurd conclusion, nor to ascribing any defect to God. These sublime and profound themes admit of no proof whatever, neither according to our opinion who believe in the teaching of Scripture, nor according to the philosophers who disagree and are much divided on this question. In all questions that cannot be demonstrated, we must adopt the method which we have adopted in this question about God's Omniscience. Note it. "

                "THE strange and wonderful Book of Job treats of the same subject as we are discussing; its basis is a fiction, conceived for the purpose of explaining the different opinions which people hold on Divine Providence. You know that some of our Sages clearly stated Job has never existed, and has never been created, and that he is a poetic fiction. Those who assume that he has existed, and that the book is historical, are unable to determine when and where Job lived. Some of our Sages say that he lived in the days of the Patriarchs; others hold that he was a contemporary of Moses; others place him in the days of David, and again others believe that he was one of those who returned from the Babylonian exile. This difference of opinion supports the assumption that he has never existed in reality. But whether he has existed or not, that which is related of him is an experience of frequent occurrence, is a source of perplexity to all thinkers, and has suggested the above-mentioned opinions on God's Omniscience and Providence. This perplexity is caused by the account that a simple and perfect person, who is upright in his actions, and very anxious to abstain from sin, is afflicted by successive misfortunes, namely, by loss of property, by the death of his children, and by bodily disease, though he has not committed any sin. According to both theories, viz., the theory that Job did exist, and the theory that he did not exist, the introduction to the book is certainly a fiction; I mean the portion which relates to the words of the adversary, the words of God to the former, and the handing over of Job to him. This fiction, however, is in so far different from other fictions that it includes profound ideas and great mysteries, removes great doubts, and reveals the most important truths. I will discuss it as fully as possible; and I will also ten you the words of our Sages that suggested to me the explanation of this great poem.",
                "First, consider the words: \"There was a man in the land Uz.\" The term Uz. has different meanings; it is used as a proper noun. Comp. \"Uz, his first-born\" (Gen. 22:21); it is also imperative of the verb Uẓ, \"to take advice.\" Comp. uẓu, \"take counsel\" (Isa. 8:10). The name Uz therefore expresses the exhortation to consider well this lesson, study it, grasp its ideas, and comprehend them, in order to see which is the right view. \"The sons of God then came to present themselves before the Lord, and the adversary came also among them and in their number\" (Job 1:6, Job 2:1). It is not said: \"And the sons of God and the adversary came to present themselves before the Lord\"; this sentence would have implied that the existence of all that came was of the same kind and rank. The words used are these: \"And the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord, and the adversary came also among them.\" Such a phrase is only used in reference to one that comes without being expected or invited; he only comes among others whose coming has been sought. The adversary is then described as going to and fro on the earth, and walking up and down thereon. He is in no relation to the beings above, and has no place among them. For this reason it is said, \"from going to and fro on the earth, and walking up and down on it,\" for his \"going\" and \"walking\" can only take place on the earth. [Job], the simple and righteous man, is given and handed over to the adversary; whatever evils and misfortunes befell Job as regards his property, children, and health, were all caused by this adversary. ",
                "When this idea is sufficiently indicated, the author begins to reflect on it: one opinion Job is represented to hold, whilst other opinions are defended by his friends. I will further on expound these opinions which formed the substance of the discussion on the misfortunes of Job, caused by the adversary alone. Job, as well as his friends, were of opinion that God Himself was the direct agent of what happened, and that the adversary was not the intermediate cause. It is remarkable in this account that wisdom is not ascribed to Job. The text does not say he was an intelligent, wise, or clever man; but virtues and uprightness, especially in actions, are ascribed to him. If he were wise he would not have any doubt about the cause of his suffering, as will be shown later on. ",
                "Besides, his misfortunes are enumerated in the same order as they rank in man's estimation. There are some who are not perplexed or discouraged by loss of property, thinking little of it: but are terrified when they are threatened with the death of their children and are killed by their anxiety. There are others who bear without shock or fainting even the loss of their children, but no one endowed with sensation is able to bear bodily pain. We generally extol God in words, and praise Him as righteous and benevolent, when we prosper and are happy, or when the grief we have to bear is moderate. But [it is otherwise] when such troubles as are described in Job come over us. Some of us deny God, and believe that there is no rule in the Universe, even if only their property is lost. Others retain their faith in the existence of justice and order, even when suffering from loss of property, whereas loss of children is too much affliction for them. Others remain firm in their faith, even with the loss of their children; but there is no one who can patiently bear the pain that reaches his own person: he then murmurs and complains of injustice either in his heart or with his tongue.",
                "Now consider that the phrase, \"to present themselves before the Lord,\" is used in reference to the sons of God, both the first and the second times, but in reference to the adversary, who appeared on either occasion among them and in their number, this phrase is not used the first time, whilst in his second appearance \"the adversary also came among them to present himself before the Lord.\" Consider this, and see how very extraordinary it is!--These ideas presented themselves like an inspiration to me.--The phrase, \"to present themselves before the Lord,\" implies that they are beings who are forced by God's command to do what He desires. This may be inferred from the words of the prophet Zechariah concerning the four chariots that came forth. He says: \"And the angel answered and said to me, These four winds of the heavens come forth from presenting themselves before the Lord of the whole earth\" (Zech. 6:5). It is clear that the relation of the sons of God to the Universe is not the same as that of the adversary. The relation of the sons of God is more constant and more permanent. The adversary has also some relation to the Universe, but it is inferior to that of the sons of God. ",
                "It is also remarkable in this account that in the description of the adversary's wandering about on the earth, and his performing certain actions, it is distinctly stated that he has no power over the soul: whilst power has been given to him over all earthly affairs, there is a partition between him and the soul; he has not received power over the soul. This is expressed in the words, \"But keep away from his soul\" (Job 2:6). I have already shown you the homonymous use of the term \"soul\" (nefesh) in Hebrew (Guide for the Perplexed 1:44). It designates that element in man that survives him; it is this Portion over which the adversary has no power. ",
                "After these remarks of mine listen to the following useful instruction given by our Sages, who in truth deserve the title of \"wise men\"; it makes clear that which appears doubtful, and reveals that which has been hidden, and discloses most of the mysteries of the Law. They said in the Talmud as follows: R. Simeon, son of Lakish, says: \"The adversary (satan), evil inclination (yeẓer ha-ra’), and the angel of death, are one and the same being.\" Here we find all that has been mentioned by us in such a clear manner that no intelligent person will be in doubt about it. It has thus been shown to you that one and the same thing is designated by these three different terms, and that actions ascribed to these three are in reality the actions of one and the same agent. Again, the ancient doctors of the Talmud said: \"The adversary goes about and misleads, then he goes up and accuses, obtains permission, and takes the soul.\" You have already been told that when David at the time of the plague was shown the angel \"with the sword drawn in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem\" (II Samuel 24:16), it was done for the purpose of conveying a certain idea to him. The same idea was also expressed in the vision concerning the sins of the sons of Joshua, the high priest, by the words, \"And the adversary stood on his right hand to accuse him\" (Zech. 3:1). The vision then reveals that [the adversary] is far from God, and continues thus: \"The Lord will rebuke thee, O adversary, the Lord who hath chosen Jerusalem win rebuke thee\" (Zech. 3:2). Balaam saw prophetically the same vision in his journey, addressing him with the words, \"Behold I have come forth to be a hindrance to thee\" (Num. 22:32). The Hebrew, satan, is derived from the same root as séteh, \"turn away\" (Prov. 4:15); it implies the notion of turning and moving away from a thing; he undoubtedly turns us away from the way of truth, and leads us astray in the way of error. The same idea is contained in the passage, \"And the imagination of the heart of man is evil from his youth\" (Gen. 8:21). The theory of the good and the evil inclinations (yeẓer ha-tob, ve-yeẓer ha-ra’) is frequently referred to in our religion. Our Sages also say, \"Serve God with your good and your evil inclinations.\" (Berachot 57a.) They also say that the evil inclination we receive at our birth: for \"at the door sin croucheth\" (Gen. 4:7), as is distinctly said in the Law, \"And the imagination of the heart of man is evil from his youth\" (Gen. 7:21). The good inclination, however, comes when the mini is developed. In explaining the allegory representing the body of man and his different faculties, our Sages (Nedarim 32b) said: \"The evil inclination is called a great king, whilst the good inclination is a child, poor, though wise\" (Eccles. 9:14). All these sayings of our Sages are contained in their writings, and are well known. According to our Sages the evil inclination, the adversary (satan), and the angel [of death], are undoubtedly identical; and the adversary being called \"angel, \"because he is among the sons of God, and the good inclination being in reality an angel, it is to the good and the evil inclinations that they refer in their well-known words, \"Every person is accompanied by two angels, one being on his right side, one on his left.\" In the Babylonian Gemara (Shabbat 119b), they say distinctly of the two angels that one is good and one bad. See what extraordinary ideas this passage discloses, and how many false ideas it removes.",
                "I believe that I have fully explained the idea contained in the account of Job; but I will now show the character of the opinion attributed to Job, and of the opinions attributed to his friends, and support my statement by proofs gathered from the words of each of them. We need not take notice of the remaining passages which are only required for the context, as has been explained to you in the beginning of this treatise.",

                "ASSUMING the first part of the history of Job as having actually taken place, the five, viz., Job and his friends, agreed that the misfortune of Job was known to God, and that it was God that caused Job's suffering. They further agree that God does no wrong, and that no injustice can be ascribed to Him. You will find these ideas frequently repeated in the words of Job. When you consider the words of the five who take part in the discussion, you will easily notice that things said by one of them are also uttered by the rest. The arguments are repeated, mixed up, and interrupted by Job's description of his acute pain and troubles, which had come upon him in spite of his strict righteousness, and by an account of his charity, humane disposition, and good acts. The replies of the friends to Job are likewise interrupted by exhortations to patience, by words of comfort, and other speeches tending to make him forget his grief. He is told by them to be silent; that he ought not to let loose the bridle of his tongue, as if he were in dispute with another man; that he ought silently to submit to the judgments of God. Job replies that the intensity of his pains did not permit him to bear patiently, to collect his thoughts and to say what he ought to say. The friends, on the other hand, contend that those who act well receive reward, and those who act wickedly are punished. When a wicked and rebellious person is seen in prosperity, it may be assumed for certain that a change will take place; he will die, or troubles will afflict him and his house. When we find a worshipper of God in misfortune, we may be certain that God will heal the stroke of his wound. This idea is frequently repeated in the words of the three friends, Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zofar, who agree in this opinion. It is, however, not the object of this chapter to describe in what they agree, but to define the distinguishing characteristic of each of them, and to elucidate the opinion of each as regards the question why the most simple and upright man is afflicted with the greatest and acutest pain. ",
                "Job found in this fact a proof that the righteous and the wicked are equal before God, who holds all mankind in contempt. Job therefore says (Job 9:22-23): \"This is one thing, therefore I said it, He destroyeth the perfect and the wicked. If the scourge slay suddenly, he will laugh at the trial of the innocent.\" He thus declares that when a scourge comes suddenly, killing and destroying all it meets, God laughs at the trial of the innocent. He further confirms this view in the following passage: \"One dieth in his full strength, being wholly at case and quiet. His vessels are full of milk, etc. And another dieth in the bitterness of his soul, and never eateth with pleasure. They shall lie down alike in the dust, and the worms shall cover them\" (Job 21:23-26). In a similar manner he shows the good condition and prosperity of wicked people; and is even very explicit on this point. He speaks thus: \"Even when I remember I am afraid, and trembling taketh hold on my flesh. Wherefore do the wicked live, become old, yea, are mighty in power? Their seed is established in their sight with them,\" etc. (Job 21:6-8). Having thus described their prosperity he addresses his opponents, and says to them: \"Granted that as you think, the children of this prosperous atheist will perish after his death, and their memory will be blotted out, what harm will the fate of his family cause him after his death? For what pleasure hath he in his house after him, when the number of his months is cut off in the midst?\" (Job 21:21). Job then explains that there is no hope after death, so that the cause [of the misfortune of the righteous man] is nothing else but entire neglect on the part of God. He is therefore surprised that God has not abandoned the creation of man altogether; and that after having created him, He does not take any notice of him. He says in his surprise: \"Hast thou not poured me out as milk, and curdled me like cheese?\" etc. (Job 10:10, seq.). This is one of the different views held by some thinkers on Providence. Our Sages (Bava Batra 16a) condemned this view of Job as mischievous, and expressed their feeling in words like the following: \"dust should have filled the mouth of Job\"; \"Job wished to upset the dish\"; \"Job denied the resurrection of the dead\"; \"He commenced to blaspheme.\" When, however, God said to Eliphaz and his colleagues, \"You have not spoken of me the thing that is right, as my servant Job hath\" (Job 42:7), our Sages assume as the cause of this rebuke, the maxim \"Man is not punished for that which he utters in his pain\"; and that God ignored the sin of Job [in his utterances], because of the acuteness of his suffering. But this explanation does not agree with the object of the whole allegory. The words of God are justified, as I will show, by the fact that Job abandoned his first very erroneous opinion, and himself proved that it was an error. It is the opinion which suggests itself as plausible at first thought, especially in the minds of those who meet with mishaps, well knowing that they have not merited them through sins. This is admitted by all, and therefore this opinion was assigned to Job. But he is represented to hold this view only so long as he was without wisdom, and knew God only by tradition, in the same manner as religious people generally know Him. As soon as he had acquired a true knowledge of God, he confessed that there is undoubtedly true felicity in the knowledge of God; it is attained by all who acquire that knowledge, and no earthly trouble can disturb it. So long as Job's knowledge of God was based on tradition and communication, and not on research, he believed that such imaginary good as is possessed in health, riches, and children, was the utmost that men can attain: this was the reason why he was in perplexity, and why he uttered the above-mentioned opinions, and this is also the meaning of his words: \"I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear; but now mine eye seeth thee. Wherefore I abhor myself, and repent because of dust and ashes\" (Job 42:5-6); that is to say he abhorred all that he had desired before, and that he was sorry that he had been in dust and ashes; comp. \"and he sat down among the ashes\" (Job 2:8). On account of this last utterance, which implies true perception, it is said afterwards in reference to him, \"for you have not spoken of me the thing that is right, as my servant Job hath.\"",
                "The opinion set forth by Eliphaz in reference to Job's suffering is likewise one of the current views on Providence. He holds that the fate of Job was in accordance with strict justice. Job was guilty of sins for which he deserved his fate. Eliphaz therefore says to Job: \"Is not thy wickedness great, and thine iniquities infinite?\" (Job 22:5). He then points out to him that his upright actions and his good ways, on which he relies, need not be so perfect in the eyes of God that no punishment should be inflicted on him. \"Behold, he putteth no trust in his servants: and his angels he chargeth with folly: how much less in them that dwell in houses of clay,\" etc. (Job 4:17-18). Eliphaz never abandoned his belief that the fate of man is the result of justice, that we do not know all our shortcomings for which we are punished, nor the way how we incur the punishment through them.",
                "Bildad the Shuhite defends in this question the theory of reward and compensation. He therefore tells Job that if he is innocent and without sin, his terrible misfortunes will be the source of great reward, will be followed by the best compensation, and will prove a boon to him as the cause of great bliss in the future world. This idea is expressed in the words: \"If thou be pure and upright, surely now he will awake for thee, and make the habitation of thy righteousness prosperous. Though thy beginning was small, yet thy latter end will greatly increase\" (Job 8:6-8). This opinion concerning, Providence is widespread, and we have already explained it.",
                "Zofar the Naamathite holds that the Divine Will is the source of everything that happens: no further cause can be sought for His actions, and it cannot be asked why He has done this and why He has not done that. That which God does can therefore not be explained by the way of justice or the result of wisdom. His true Essence demands that He does what He wills; we are unable to fathom the depth of His wisdom, and it is the law and rule of this wisdom that whatever He does is done because it is His will and for no other cause. Zofar therefore says to Job: \"But oh that God would speak, and open his lips against thee; and that he would show thee the secrets of wisdom, for wisdom hath two portions I Know, therefore, that God exacteth of thee less than thine iniquity deserveth. Canst thou by searching find out God? canst thou find out the Almighty unto perfection?\" (Job 11:6-7).",
                "In this manner consider well how the Book of Job discusses the problem, which has perplexed many people ` and led them to adopt in reference to Divine Providence some one of the theories which I have explained above: all possible different theories are mentioned therein. The problem is described either by way of fiction or in accordance with real fact, as having manifested itself in a man famous for his excellency and wisdom. The view ascribed to Job is the theory of Aristotle. Eliphaz holds the opinion taught in Scripture, Bildad's opinion is identical with that of the Mu’tazilah, whilst Zofar defends the theory of the Asha’riyah. These were the ancient views on Providence; ",
                "Later on a new theory was set forth, namely, that ascribed to Elihu. For this reason he is placed above the others, and described as younger in years but greater in wisdom. He censures Job for his foolishly exalting himself, expressing surprise at such great troubles befalling a good man, and dwelling on the praises of his own deeds. He also tells the three friends that their minds have been weakened by great age. A profound and wonderful discourse then follows. Reflecting on his words we may at first thought be surprised to find that he does not add anything to the words of Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zofar; and that he only repeats their ideas in other terms and more explicitly. For he likewise censures and rebukes Job, attributes justice to God, relates His wonders in nature, and holds that God is not affected by the service of the worshipper, nor by the disobedience of the rebellious. All this has already been said by His colleagues. But after due consideration we see clearly the new idea introduced by Elihu, which is the principal object of his speech, an idea which has not been uttered by those who spoke before him. In addition to this he mentions also other things set forth by the previous speakers, in the same manner as each of the rest, viz., Job and his three friends, repeat what the others have said. The purpose of this repetition is to conceal the opinion peculiar to each speaker, and to make all appear in the eyes of the ordinary reader to utter one and the same view, although in reality this is not the case. The new idea, which is peculiar to Elihu and has not been mentioned by the others, is contained in his metaphor of the angel's intercession. It is a frequent occurrence, he says, that a man becomes ill, approaches the gates of death, and is already given up by his neighbours. If then an angel, of any kind whatever, intercedes on his behalf and prays for him, the intercession and prayers are accepted; the patient rises from his illness, is saved, and returns to good health. This result is not always obtained: intercession and deliverance do not always follow each other: it happens only twice, or three times. Elihu therefore says: \"If there be an angel with him, an interpreter, one among a thousand, to show unto man his uprightness,\" etc. (Job 33:29). He then describes man's condition when convalescent and the rejoicing at his recovery, and continues thus: \"Lo, all these things worketh God twice, three times with man\" (Job 33:29). This idea occurs only in the words of Elihu. His description of the method of prophecy in preceding verses is likewise new. He says: \"Surely God speaketh in one way, yea in two ways, yet man perceiveth it not. In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falleth upon man, in slumberings upon the bed\" (Job 33:14:15). He afterwards supports and illustrates his theory by a description of many natural phenomena, such as thunder, lightning, rain, and winds; with these are mixed up accounts of various incidents of life, e.g., an account of pestilence contained in the following passage: \"In a moment they die, and at midnight; the people become tumultuous and pass away\" (Job 34:20). Great wars are described in the following verse: \"He breaketh in pieces mighty men without number, and setteth others in their stead\" (Job 34:24). There are many more passages of this kind. ",
                "In a similar manner the Revelation that reached Job (Job 38, Job 41), and explained to him the error of his whole belief, constantly describes natural objects, and nothing else; it describes the elements, meteorological phenomena, and peculiarities of various kinds of living beings. The sky, the heavens, Orion and Pleiades are only mentioned in reference to their influence upon our atmosphere, so that Job's attention is in this prophecy only called to things below the lunar sphere. Elihu likewise derives instruction from the nature of various kinds of animals. Thus he says: \"He teacheth us through the beasts of the earth, and maketh us wise through the fowls of heaven\" (Job 35:11). He dwells longest on the nature of the Leviathan, which possesses a combination of bodily peculiarities found separate in different animals, in those that walk, those that swim, and those that fly. The description of all these things serves to impress on our minds that we are unable to comprehend how these transient creatures come into existence, or to imagine how their natural properties commenced to exist, and that these are not like the things which we are able to produce. Much less can we compare the manner in which God rules and manages His creatures with the manner in which we rule and manage certain beings. We must content ourselves with this, and believe that nothing is hidden from God, as Elihu says: \"For his eyes are upon the ways of man, and he seeth all his goings. There is no darkness nor shadow of death, where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves\" (Job 34:21-22). But the term management, when applied to God, has not the same meaning which it has when applied to us; and when we say that He rules His creatures we do not mean that He does the same as we do when we rule over other beings. The term \"rule\" has not the same definition in both cases: it signifies two different notions, which have nothing in common but the name. In the same manner, as there is a difference between works of nature and productions of human handicraft, so there is a difference between God's rule, providence, and intention in reference to all natural forces, and our rule, providence, and intention in reference to things which are the objects of our rule, providence, and intention. ",
                "This lesson is the principal object of the whole Book of Job; it lays down this principle of faith, and recommends us to derive a proof from nature, that we should not fall into the error of imagining His knowledge to be similar to ours, or His intention, providence, and rule similar to ours. When we know this we shall find everything that may befall us easy to bear; mishap will create no doubts in our hearts concerning God, whether He knows our affairs or not, whether He provides for us or abandons us. On the contrary, our fate will increase our love of God; as is said in the end of this prophecy: \"Therefore I abhor myself and repent concerning the dust and ashes\" (Job 42:6); and as our Sages say: \"The pious do everything out of love, and rejoice in their own afflictions.\" (Shabbat 88b.) If you pay to my words the attention which this treatise demands, and examine all that is said in the Book of Job, all will be clear to you, and you will find that I have grasped and taken hold of the whole subject; nothing has been left unnoticed, except such portions as are only introduced because of the context and the whole plan of the allegory. I have explained this method several times in the course of this treatise. "
