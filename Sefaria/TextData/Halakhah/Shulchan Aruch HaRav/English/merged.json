                "Yehudah son of Teimah says: \" Be Bold as a leopard and and light as an eagle , swift as a deer and strong as a lion to carry out the will of your Father in heaven.'Bold as a leopard' means one should not to be humiliated by people who ridicule [him]. 'Strong as a lion' [refers to] moral strength which is primarily in the heart, [to act] like a lion and overpower ones evil urge and rise from ones sleep before the morning light, to serve one's Creator. So that he awake the morning, as it states, (Psalms, 57:9 )\"I awake the morning\", [Meaning] I awake the morning but the morning doesn't wake me. This is the intermediate level. "
