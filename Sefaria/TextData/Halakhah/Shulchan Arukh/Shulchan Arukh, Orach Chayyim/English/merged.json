For a person's way of sitting, his movements and his dealings while he is alone in his house are not like his way of sitting, his movements and his dealings when he is before a great king; nor are his speech and free expression as much as he wants when he is with his household members and his relatives like his speech when in a royal audience. All the more so when one takes to heart that the Great King, the Holy One, Blessed Is He, Whose glory fills the earth, is standing over him and watching his actions, as it is stated: \"'Will a man hide in concealment and I will not see him?' - the word of God\" (Jeremiah 23:24), he immediately acquires fear and submission in dread of God, May He Be Blessed, and is ashamed of Him constantly (Guide for the Perplexed III 52). And one should not be ashamed because of people who mock him in his service of God, and should also go modestly.

And even though they mention the foreign idol, nevertheless their intention is to the Creator of heaven and earth, except that they join the name of Heaven and (foreign gods). And we do not find that there is in this (a violation by the Jew of) \"Before a blind person you shall not place a stumbling block,\" because the kusim are not enjoined regarding partnership (of God with idols).

In the event one has no such drink to make a blessing one, one is even required to hold himself back and postpone eating one meal in the event where he may obtain it if he waits.  Therefore, is two are eating together they are both required to have their own individual cup of wine.  There are others who say that a cup of wine is not needed unless three men eat together.  Further authorities claim that even with three men, no cup of wine is required at all.  [None-the-less, it is a greater Mitzvah to say the blessing with a cup of wine.]",
            "The beverage for Birchas Hamazone must be wine and not any other beverage, even if one normally uses these beverages for meals.  If wine can’t be found in that place then use liquor, beer or any other beverages considered important in your province; excluding water.  [Since is customary in our provinces to say the blessing on liquor or beer one need not protest over using such a beverage.  This is due to the fact that there are authorities that say no beverage is required at all.  Additionally, the main beverage of distinction in our province is beer and we even drink it with our meals.  Even though wine is found in our cities, none-the-less, we do not consider it as such, since it is expensive.  Therefore, it is unrealistic to buy wine for each meal to say the blessing.   However, it is a greater Mitzvah to accompany the blessing with wine.  There are those authorities maintain that when an individual makes Birchas Hamazone with a drink, he should not hold it in his hand.  Rather, the cup should be left on the table before them.  This is a good custom based on the Kabbalah.] ",

However, if one poured out some of the contents into one’s hand or into a vessel, it is not considered blemished.  Even if one drank from the bottle or from the small barrel, it is considered a blemish.  But, if one previously drank from a large wood barrel, one need not be concerned.  There are those who say that even if blemished water is mixed with the beverage, it is forbidden to make a blessing on such a drink. ",
            "If several people were dining together and only one had a non-blemished drink; before the leader drinks from his cup, he should pour some out into each of their cups provided that there are empty cups available.  There are those who say that this is not necessary. ",
            "If you poured a cup of blemished drink back into the bottle, the drink used from the bottle is not considered blemished.  This is due to the fact that the large amount of beverage in the bottle makes insignificant the blemished drink. ",

But you don't cut hair until the day of the 33rd not the night before. However if the 33rd falls out on Sunday we have a custom to cut hair on the Friday before out of respect for Shabbat.

There are those who have the custom to dress in Shabbat/Yom Tov clothes on Purim, and that is correct (Maharil). We have the custom to make the Purim meal after the afternoon prayer, and pray the evening prayer at night. We pray the afternoon prayer while most of the day remains, and most of the meal needs to be during the day (Minhagim).

And one who wants to [have his meal] every [Purim] in the morning is allowed to (T\"H). Some say that there is [significance] to eating seeds on Purim as a remembrence for the seeds that Daniel and his friends ate in Babylonia (Kol Bo). It is good to delve a bit in Torah before one begins the meal, and a support for that is (Esther 8:16) \"The Jews had light and happiness...\", which we learn out \"radiance\" - that's Torah (Mahariv). One is obligated to drink a little and be a little happy on two days, the 14th and the 15th (Minhagim), and so is the custom. And some say that if one causes damage to his fellow through his happiness on Purim, he is exempt from restitution (T\"H Siman 110). And see T\"H Laws of Damage.",

If he has none, he can trade with his fellow, this one sending to that one his meal, and this one sending to that one his meal, so that they can fulfill \"And send portions, man to his fellow.\" Rama: And some send the portions during the day and not at night (from the Rosh, first chapter of [Bavli] Megilla). And if one sends portions to his fellow, but he doesn't want to accept them, or he forgives him [his obligation], he fulfills [his obligation nonetheless]. And a woman is obligated in [sending] portions to the destitute and sending portions [to one's fellows] like a man is. A woman sends to a woman, a man to a man. But not the other way, so that a man does not come to send it to a widow, and it will come to a possibility of kiddushin [having been enacted].
