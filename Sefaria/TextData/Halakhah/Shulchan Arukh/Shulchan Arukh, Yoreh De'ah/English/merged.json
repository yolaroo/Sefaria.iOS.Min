On the right side there is another small lobe called the \"small roseate lobe\", not in line with the minor lobes, rather it projects from the front.

If the upper left minor lobe is larger than the upper right minor lobe - terefah.  Similarly, if the major right lobe is larger than the left - all this is called 'reversed' and is terefah.  The roseate small lobe - if it's absent, or if it's on the left side - kosher. HGH: In these lands we regard zero or two small roseate lobes, or a roseate lobe on the wrong side, terefah, and it is proper to do so, and many of our rabbis agree, and custom should not be changed. Similarly, if its appearance or shape differs from the norm - terefah.  If there are two roseate lobes with a common finger-thick base: even though it has a crack, it's kosher.  And if one is upside down and the other normal, we follow the larger, if that is right side up, it's kosher.  The roseate lobe is normally in a pocket.  </i>",

Ideally, the most proper way to rinse the meat is to have it soak in water for about half an hour, and then to wipe it in the water. [5] However if one simply rinsed the meat without soaking, it would be sufficient. Afterwards [6] (4) wait a little so as to allow some of the water to evaporate so that the salt will not immediately dissolve from the water once placed on the meat, and thereby not remove any blood. [7] (5) It is customary not to use the vessel used for salting meat for any other purpose. (6) If the meat was left soaking for twenty four hours then [8] the meat, and vessel are both forbidden to be used. [9] (see further on in this chapter) but one need not worry if it has been less than twenty four hours. Even in the case were the vessel has become forbidden, [10] one may use it for the purposes of soaking. [11] For the laws of frozen meat see chapter 78. </i>",

Rema: And this is our custom even if it was (8) only slightly salted as in preparation for roasting, and [13] even if it wasn’t sitting in the salt for the entire time requirement, (9) however in the case of a great loss we can permit it. (10) If the meat was rinsed only slightly before having been salted, it is [14] permissible post facto. [15] The same is true if there was a sixty to one ratio of meat against the blood on it. If one salted a piece of meat without previously washing it with other pieces, (11)[16] the other pieces are permitted, but this piece is forbidden. ",

[19] More salt than this is not needed. The salting must be done on both sides of the meat, (13)<i> and the insides of poultry must also be salted. In a case where one only salted the inside or outside, or only one side of the meat, it is acceptable. </i>Rema: [20] And there are those who forbid it even post facto, and this is how one should act (14) unless there is a great need. [21] This is only if it was cooked already, but if it wasn’t cooked yet, it may not be cooked as is. [22] Rather, if it is within (15) twelve hours of having been salted one must go back and salt the side that was not salted and then cook it. If it is after twelve hours, then roast the meat [23] and through this process the heat and fire will draw out the blood.

Some will even permit the meat if it was placed in a vessel with no water [32] because we need not fear problems in the short period of time used for rinsing the meat, and one may rely on this and not worry except for the first rinsing, after the first rinsing there are no fears.

However, initially one must be careful even with dry meat that  it should not be cooked or even washed in hot water without being  first washed of it’s salt. All this is referring to a case where meat has  not been washed off of it's salt at all, however if even only slightly  washed once, and then cooked, it is permitted, post facto , for post  facto one washing is sufficient.

            "We perform the salting only in a vessel with holes or upon straw or shavings or in  a diagonal position insuring that if water was spilled onto it, it would flow off  immediately. Rema: An especially smooth surface that water would flow from  need not be placed in a slanted position. however if it’s not this smooth it must be placed slanted so that the water flows out. Even in a vessel with holes, one  should be careful to make sure the holes are open, therefore it should not be  placed on the ground, for then it is as a vessel without holes. As a result of this  some people are stringent and place straw or shavings because even the meat  can close up the holes. (38) Post facto, one need not worry about all this. If one  performed the salting in a vessel without holes (39) [63] it is forbidden to use the  vessel with very hot items. Rema: [64] And if it was used then one must take off a  klipah for a dry item, and if it was a liquid we need sixty against the klipah of the  vessel.

            "(42) But if it has holes [69] it is permissible to eat boiling hot food from it, and there are some that forbid boiling hot [70]One should be careful  initially (43) but post facto, it is permitted. ",
            "Meat [71] that was salted in a vessel without holes [72] and was left for as  long as it takes for water to begin boiling is subject to the following rules:  Anything in the tzir is forbidden even for roasting, and what is outside the  tzir is not forbidden [73] expect for a klipah’s worth, even if it is fatty.  Rema: (44) [74] Some forbid the entire piece, even that which is outside  the tzir, even if only salted slightly as is done in preparation for roasting  [75] and even if it was not left for the required salting time rather only for a  little while allowing for tzir to be seen [76] this is the custom, and it should  not be changed. Nevertheless, only the actual piece that is touching the  tzir is forbidden (45) [77] but the other pieces that are upon it and salted  with it are permitted, and this is indeed the custom. ",
            "After meat has been salted and washed, it may even be placed in water that is not boiling [78] and there are those that require it to be placed in boiling water. Rema: The custom is to follow the first opinion. ",
            "Meat that was salted for as long as required and then placed in a vessel without holes without being washed off [79] and then filled up with tzir is permitted. (46) According to this, meat that fell into tzir that came out of the meat (47) after the required salting time is permitted. There are those who forbid it no matter what, and they should be followed initially. Rema: [80] And some forbid even post facto (48) [81] a klipah and this is the custom, regarding that which is in the tzir. However, anything outside the tzir is permitted. (49) [82] The vessel into which the tzir fell is forbidden, [83] Therefore if the vessel was dairy (50) and is dirty, the meat is forbidden since even after the salting time it is considered roseiach [84] however if it is a case of great loss and needed for a mitzvah (51) one may be lenient and say that once the required salting time has passed, it is no longer considered roseiach. (52) [85] According to his words even though meat sat in salt its required time, one may not eat it until it is washed off well. It is forbidden to cut it with a knife before it gets washed [86] and if cut, the knife must be kashered. Rema: [87] And some permit it to be cut with a knife after it went through it’s required salting time [88] for salt can not affect vessels [89] and it is indeed permitted [90] but the knife must be washed off [91] or thrusted into the ground if the tzir has already dried. Even if it is before the required salting time has passed (53) there is no prohibition on the knife, rather the problem is now that blood had come out from the meat to its surface, if one wants to now wash off that spot and go re-salt it one may do so. If one wants to then go and perform a salting in order to preserve the meat after it has been property salted for blood in a vessel with holes, [92] then the meat must be washed off well and re-salted. It may even be re-salted in a vessel without holes. If one wants [93] to salt meat and eat it roasted without washing one may do so and we are not worried about the blood that is on the salt, for the fire sucks out the blood and the salt can not absorb it. This is when it is salted and put on to be roasted, but if it sat in the salt, the salt absorbs blood, and the meat becomes forbidden. Therefore, it must be washed off well, then roasted, and then it may be eaten. See later on in section 76 regarding the law for meat that was salted without being washed off, and then roasted) ",

            "One is permitted to salt many pieces of meat together, one on top of the other,  even though the lower pieces will finish releasing their blood before the upper  pieces. We do not assume that the lower pieces will now absorb blood from the  upper pieces. This is because meat releases tzir for a long period of time and as  long as (1) it is releasing it can not absorb. Even if a lot of tzir is gathering and  sitting in the crevices of the meat, it is permitted. When do we say this rule? When  meat is being salted with other pieces of meat, even if it is meat from one animal  with the meat of another animal, even if it is poultry [1] which can not expel all its  tzir before the meat of an ox can expel its blood. Rema: Nevertheless it is  customary to initially be stringent with a piece of meat that has a pocket and invert  it inside out as to allow the blood to flow out, however post facto one need not  worry, [2] A piece of meat salted twice is permitted [3] and we are not worried that  this second salting will cause it to absorb any remaining blood from the first  salting. However meat with fish, and even poultry with fish are forbidden to be  salted together for fish release all their tzir before even poultry can release its  blood. [4] If one did salt them together, the poultry is permitted, but the fish must  have a klipah removed [5] and if (3) one did not remove the scales when they  were salted - it is permitted. Rema: There are those who forbid all the fish if there  is not sixty against the poultry for we measure all cases of salting with sixty, and  this is the custom. This is only if there are no scales, for they are soft and  immediately release tzir, bur if there are scales it is permitted for they do not  release immediately nor absorb from the poultry because as long as they are in  the process of expelling they won't absorb and it is like any other case of meat  being salted together   ",
            "In which cases is this said? When they were salted together, or if the  poultry was salted and the fish was not. (4) However if the fish is salty and  the poultry is not and they were placed beside each other [6] or on top of  each other, even the fish is permitted without removing a klipah. <i>Rema: (5)  [8] And so too if the fish [9] are placed on the poultry </i>they are permitted  even if they were salted together since the blood does not flow from  bottom to top, and it is no worse then a piece placed in the tzir in which  what is protruding from the tzir is permitted. If the fish were placed beside  the poultry [11] only (6) after the [12] poultry lay in their salt for the required  salting time, then even the fish are permitted even though they are both  salty. [13] If fish were salted in a vessel in which meat was salted, the fish  are permitted (7) for the fish do not absorb the blood in the vessel because  the salting has no effect on a vessel [14] That which we say that the fish  are forbidden if salty and the poultry is salty, is only when the fish [15] had  released all of their blood and have been washed, (8) but if they still did  not release their blood and were never salted, they are permitted because  when they release their own blood, they will release the blood they  absorbed from the poultry just like a piece that fell into tzir before being  salted. It is permitted for this reason as will be explained below. [16] See  further in section 91 regarding which salting is considered as roseiach.   ",
            "(9) Kosher meat that was salted with non-kosher meat, or non-kosher  meat that is salty with kosher meat that is not salty, [17] require the  removal of a klipah if they are touching [18] because even though it does  not absorb from the non-kosher blood, it absorbs from it’s tzir. However, if  the kosher meat is salted and the non-kosher meat is non-salty then it is  permitted even without removing a klipah as long as it is washed. This is  true whether the kosher piece is on the top or on the bottom.

Rema: (15) [30]  Even post-facto we customarily forbid meat [31] that has released all of its  blood and tzir and fell into meat that still did not complete the required  salting time. Some say that meat can release tzir for an entire twenty four  hour period after being salted. (16) [32] If during this time it touched meat  that had not completed the required salting time period, the meat is not  forbidden, and this is indeed the custom. [33] However, if there is no great  loss it should be forbidden if it is after 12 hours, but before this time one  need not be stringent at all, and surely if it had not been salted yet for even  if it had fallen into actual tzir it wouldn’t be forbidden for we say [34] that  when it releases it’s own blood, it will release anything else that it could  have absorbed. Even if the meat has been salted but has not sat for the  required salting time and fell into tzir [35] it may be permitted,[36] if it did  not sit in the tzir for an entire day. [37] If it had sat for the entire salting time  and then fell into tzir, some forbid it even though the releasing of tzir has  not been completed. Nevertheless, in a case of great loss it may be  permitted during the entire time that the meat releases tzir [38] which is  twelve hours [39] if it is re-washed and salted. [40] If it fell into tzir [41]  before the end of the required salting period re-wash and re-salt it. (18)  [42] However, if it was salted without being washed after it had fallen into  tzir [43] it is permitted post facto. All these cases are referring to tzir that  has the status of roseiach as explained in section 69. but blood (dam  b’eyn) that fell on meat [44] during the salting period that is considered  roseiach as explained later on in section 91, causes the meat to be  forbidden, for regarding this blood we don’t say that since the meat is now  in the process of releasing blood, it will release this blood as well, nor do  we say that “as it absorbed so will it release.\" (19) Regarding the case in  which we forbid it when it fell into tzir is only true for the part that is actually  in the tzir [45] but whatever is protruding from the tzir is permitted, [46]  however (20) what is in the tzir becomes forbidden immediately. Meat that  fell into tzir that is on the ground [47] is as if it was in a vessel without  holes. Meat that touched a piece that was salted in a vessel without holes  and became forbidden [48] has the same law as if it had touched tzir. In a  case of doubt of water or tzir, it is permitted, [49] for tzir is of rabbinical  origin so in a case of doubt we are lenient. Tzir mixed with water, [50] even  with only a little water, is no longer considered roseiach and cannot cause  meat to become forbidden. For the laws of soaking see section 105.   "

But if it was stirred from beginning until end or was covered from the time of [milk] falling in until the end, everything joins together to nullify the taste of milk. <i>Therefore, if it wasn't stirred at all, not at the beginning and not at the end, and wasn't covered at all, if there is sixty in the pot compared to the drop of milk that fell in, it only prohibits the piece alone, and the rest of the pot is permitted (Bet Yosef in the name of the Ra'avid and Magid Mishnah in the name of the Rambam.) And also if it was stirred at the beginning or covered immediately even though it wasn't stirred or covered at the end, all of the pot joins together, if it was stirred or covered immediately when the prohibited matter fell in (Tur and Bet Yosef in the name of the Ri N Haviv.)</i>  Therefore, if [the milk] fell into the soup or onto a piece and we don't know onto which piece it fell, stir the whole pot until it's all mixed.  If in the whole pot there is a taste of milk, it's prohibited, and if not, it's permitted.  And if there is no non-Jew to taste and be relied on, we measure with sixty (until now, the language of the Rambam.)  <i>There are those who disagree and reason that stirring the pot isn't effective unless it's stirred immediately after the prohibited matter fell in, and this is our practice.</i>   ",

And if it is given to someone who is zealous about his actions, and he is suspected of eating non-kosher, it is forbidden, as perhaps he will damage what he was given and then switch it out with his own food. How? If one gives something to his father in law who is suspected regarding forbidden things, it is forbidden, because of the shame of marriage, and he wants to make his daughter look good, and therefore he will switch out something bad with something good. And thus if one gives something to an innkeeper who is suspect, sometimes he is embarrassed of his guest and will switch something bad for something good.

If he said, \"I bought it from so-and-so the cheesemaker,\" he is believed. If he brings a gift from the cheesemaker, he is believed, because he is not suspected of switching products. About what are we speaking? When there is no suspicion of outright robber, but if he is suspected of this, then he is suspected of switching products. And all this is not regarding someone who is suspected of breaking Torah laws.",

But this is only in his presence, but when not in his presence, it is not necessary to conduct mourning rituals. [However, this is true] other than with regard to his wife, who, even though he would mourn over her, he does not mourn with her, except for her father or her mother because of [the mitzvah of] honoring one's father-in-law and mother-in-law, but over her brother and sister or her son and daughter from another man, one does not mourn with her. But in any event, he cannot force her to adorn herself, but she can mix a cup for him and make his bed and wash his face and hands and legs. And similarly, she does not mourn with him, except for when her father-in-law or mother-in-law dies, but other of his relatives who die, she does not mourn with him. {Rema: And there are those who say that nowadays, the practice is to be lenient in this mourning with those for whom one would mourn, because this is only for the honor of the mourners, and nowadays all of them relinquish their honor. And thus the practice nowadays is not to mourn at all with those for whom one would mourn, and all who are strict with regard to this are considered shocking. But in any event, the practice is that all the relatives of the dead person who are forbidden to him as witnesses indicate a little of mourning themselves for all of the first week. That is to say, until after the first Shabbat, they do not wash and they do not change some of their clothing as they would on other Shabbatot. And there are places where the practice is to be stringent in other ways, but the essence is like I wrote. And all this is for word of a death that arrived soon after the death, or who was at the house when he died, but one who long after the death, there is no place for this mourning at all. [But] one who wants to be stringent for himself to mourn one for whom it is not necessary or to wear black on account of his relative, we do not prevent him}.",

But from then onward, one mourns for him unless it is known that he was born after eight (months of gestation which would be considered unviable). But if one can trust that his months were completed, as in a case when he had sex and then separated and it was born alive after nine complete months, even if the baby died on the day it was born, one mourns over it.

And now the practice is to take off shoes immediately after the closing of the burial slab as is [discussed] in Siman 376.

From when they despair of searching (lit. requesting). If they found him dismembered (lit. limbs by limbs) and they identify him by signs on his body they do not count until they find his head and the majority of his body or they despair of searching. And if they find him after they had despaired of finding him, the relatives do not need to go back and mourn; but the sons, if they were present at the moment he was found, they mourn on the same day, since it is not any less significant than the gathering his father’s bones. But if they are not there but they heard after the day had passed, they do not need to mourn. Gloss: If they sent their deceased to another city in which case the law is to start mourning when they turn around, and they began to count the period of mourning, and afterwards, the deceased was captured and it was not possible to be bury him for a long time, they do not need to stop their mourning and they do not need to go back and mourn afterwards, for since their rule is to begin immediately, they do not need to stop."

            "A mourner is forbidden to engage in greetings. How does this work? For the first three days he does not greet anyone and if others do not know that he is mourning and greet him, he should not respond to them. Rather, he should inform them that he is mourning. From the third to the seven day, he should not greet people, but if others do not know that he is mourning and greet him, he should respond. From the seventh day to the 30th day, he can greet others, for they are dwelling peacefully, but others should not greet him. And all the more so, he can respond to one who greets him. After 30 days he is like any other person. To what does this [the previous laws] refer? For his other relatives, but for his father and mother, he can greet others after seven days but others should not greet him until after 12 months. Rema: And since he is forbidden from greeting, all the more so [is he forbidden from] being overly talkative. But if he is acting for the honor of the public, for example, many people are coming to greet comfort him, he is permitted to say to them, “go home in peace,” because this is permitted for the honor of the public. And there are those who are lenient in this age [regarding] greeting a mourner after 30 days, and they don’t have a [good]reason, unless they will make a distinction and say that that which we do is not called [i.e. considered like] the “greeting” that was in their day",
            "One who finds his fellow a mourner in the first 30 days, he should comfort him but should not greet him. After 30 days he can greet him, but should not comfort him in the usual manner, rather in an subtle way, namely, that he should not mention to him the name of the deceased, rather he should say to him, “be comforted.” If his wife died and he married someone else, one should not enter [the mourner’s] house to comfort him. If he found him in the marketplace he should say to him, “be comforted,” in a soft voice and with seriousness. But if he has not remarried he should comfort him until 3 festivals have passed. And for one’s father or mother one should comfort him all 12 months and after 12 months one should comfort him in an subtle way."

And even if the year is intercalated [such that it has 13 months] one is permitted to after 12 months… Rama: And a gathering for a mitzvah, such as one who marries a male or female orphan for the sake of Heaven, and if he does not eat there the thing will not happen, he is allowed to after 30 days, but during the 30 days he cannot go to any Mitzvah meals in the world. But a Mitzvah meal where there is not joy he is allowed to attend, such as a Pidyon HaBen or a Brit Milah meal, and he is allowed to eat there even if it is during the Shiva, provided that he does not leave his home. And there are those who forbid eating at the meal of a Brit Milah and the custom is to not eat in any banquet during the 12 months if it is outside of his home, and inside the home we are lenient and he can eat during the Brit Milah meal and all the more so during meals that do not have joy. But in the wedding meal one should be stringent for it—so it seems to me. A mourner who is the father of a son to be circumcised or is a Mohel may wear clothes for Shabbat until after the Bris and he is allowed to attend the Bris to eat there if it is after the 30 days even though the Bris is not in his home.",

Rama: But do not enter the house at all when they are engaged in entertaining the Bride and Groom, and such is the Ashkenazic custom and in these countries. And all of this applies to a where the wedding occurs, but the Chuppah that they do in the synagogue, where they recite the blessings over the bethrothal and the marriage, and this is not considered festive, he is allowed to attend immedately after the Shiva is over, and there are those who forbid until after 30 days, and so it appears to me. And there are places that are strict for the mourner to stay during the 12 months outside the synagogue to hear the blessings, and in any case it appears that the Mourner can bless the betrothal and wedding blessings beneath the Chuppah that is in the synagogue and he can bring in the groom, as is the custom of our land, that two people bring in the groom under the Chuppah. And he can wear some Shabbat clothes at the time that he brings him in, and only if this is after the 30 days and this is the custom. There are those who permit the mourner to eat at a wedding meal or at a Bris with the servants, but only if it is not at the place of joy, for example, at another house. And there are those who forbid this, and such is the custom. Rather, the mourner should do some service there, if he wants, and eat in his house from what was sent from the meal. There are those who permit him to eat at that meal of fish that is made after the wedding, for since they have already ended saying “that the joy that we have is in God’s midst,” there is a reminder that there is not festivity in that meal, so it is permitted. There are those who say it is forbidden for one to eat in a meal at night in the day after the death of a mother or father."
