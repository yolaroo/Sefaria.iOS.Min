                "“A positive commandment” – So wrote the Rambam, who thinks that tefillah is a positive biblical commandment, as it is written, “and to serve God with all of your heart…”  But biblically, it is sufficient to recite one prayer a day, in any formulation that one wishes.  Therefore, most women have the practice of not praying regularly, because immediately after washing their hands in the morning they say some request, and this is biblically sufficient, and it is possible that the sages did not extend their obligation any further.  But the Ramban thinks that tefillah is rabbinic, and this is the opinion of most decisors."
