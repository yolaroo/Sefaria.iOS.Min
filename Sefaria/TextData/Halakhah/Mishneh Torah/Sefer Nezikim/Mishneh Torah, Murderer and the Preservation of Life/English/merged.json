The one who throws a stone into the public domain and it kills [someone] or the one who is taking down his wall into the public domain and a stone fell and it killed [someone]. Either when he took it down during the day or when he took it down at night, behold, he is [considered] grossly negligent and is not exiled [to the city of refuge] because it is a crime, because he should have looked and [only then] afterwards he can throw [the stone] or take down the wall.",

If many people are not common there at all, behold, it is [considered to be] a freak accident and he is exempt from exile.",
