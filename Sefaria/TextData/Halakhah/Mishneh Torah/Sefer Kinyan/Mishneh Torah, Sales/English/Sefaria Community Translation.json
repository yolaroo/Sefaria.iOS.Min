            "A purchase is not sold by what one says, even when witnesses testify on such. How [does this work]? [If a seller says to an buyer for example] \"This house I sell to you\", \"This wine I sell to you\", \"This slave I sell to you\", then they decide a price. The buys wants [such a deal] and says, \"I purchased it\", and the seller wants [such a deal] and says, \"I sold it\". They say to witnesses, \"Be witnesses for us so that [you can testify] that one sold and one bought\". Indeed however, this [their testimony] is worthless, and it is as if they never talked. This is true for the giving and receiving of gifts. ",
            "But if a purchase is sold by one of the ways in which it can be sold [properly], the buyer acquires it and there is no need for witnesses at all. Neither one of them [the seller and the buyer] can renege on such. ",
