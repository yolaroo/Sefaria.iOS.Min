            "The Reading of the Megillah in its (proper) time is a positive *Rabbinic* commandment. And it is known that it is a Rabbinic enactment. All are obligated in its reading: men, women, converts, and freed slaves. And we educate minors in its reading. Even Priests engaged in worship cease their worship and come to hear the reading of the Megillah, and similarly do we cease Torah study to hear the reading of the Megillah. How much more so, then, are all other commandments of the Torah superseded by the reading of the Megillah. There is nothing that the reading of the Megillah does not supersede, except the burial of a deceased person who has no relatives; one who encounters his [corpse] buries it first, then reads [Megillah].",
            "The same is true of the reader and the person who hears the reader, they have both fulfilled their obligation. And this is so if he heard it from someone who was obligated to read it. Therefore, if the reader was a minor or a fool, the person who heard it has not fulfilled his obligation.",

            "The capital of Shushan, though it was not surrounded by a wall at the time of Joshua son of Nun reads it on the fifteenth, because the miracle occurred there, as it says, \"And on the fifteenth day of the same they rested\" (Esther 9:18). So why was it [the date] made dependent on the days of Joshua? In order to honor the Land of Israel, which was in ruins at that time. So they read it like the people of Shushan do, and consider themselves to be surrounded by a wall, even though they are now in ruins, since they were walled cities in the time of Joshua they read it on the fifteenth, and there is a reminder of the Land of Israel in this miracle.",
