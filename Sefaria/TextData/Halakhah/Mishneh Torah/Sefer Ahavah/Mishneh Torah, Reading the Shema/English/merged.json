            "The Shema is recited twice every day, once in the evening and once in the morning, as it is said: Recite them when you stay at home and when you are away, when you lie down and when you get up (Deut. 6: 7). The time when people customarily lie down is evening and the time when people customarily get up is morning.",
            "What does one recite? The three paragraphs beginning with the words Hear (Deut. 6:4-9); If, then, you obey (Deut. II: 13-21); and The Lord said (Num. 15:37-41). The paragraph Hear is recited first because it contains commandments concerning God's unity, the love of God, and the study of God, which is the basic principle on which all depends? After it, If, then, you obey, is recited since the passage commands obedience to all the other commandments. After that, the paragraph concerning the fringes is recited, since it also contains a command to recall all the commandments....",
            "Even though the commandment of wearing fringes does apply at night, one reads the passage because it has a reminder of the Exodus from Egypt. It is a commandment to recite the Exodus from Egypt as it is stated: So that you will remember the Exodus from Egypt all the days of your life (Deut. 16:3). These three sections ordered as such form the recitation of the Shema.",
            "While reading the Shema, when one finishes the first verse, one says quietly, 'Blessed is the name of the glory of His kingdom forever\". Then one reads as normal, \"And you will love the Lord, your God...\" (Deut. 6:5-9). Why does one read as such? Our tradition says that Jacob the Patriarch, nearing death, gathered his sons in Egypt and commanded them urgently concerning God's unity, and the path of God that Abraham and Isaac, Jacob's father, has walked. He asked them, \"My sons, could it be that among you is a lowlife, who does not stand with me concerning God's Unity?\" This is similar to when Moses our Teacher said to us, \"Lest there is among you a man or woman...\"(Deut. 29:17). The brothers all answered, \"Hear, O Israel, God is our Lord, God is one\". That is to say: Listen to us our Father, Israel, God is our Lord, God is one. The elder said, \"Blessed is the name of the glory of His kingdom forever\". Therefore, all Jews out of custom say the praise that Israel the Elder said after this verse. ",
            "When reading the Shema, one blesses before reading and after. During the day, one says two blessings before and one after. During the night, one says two blessing before and two after.",
            "The first blessing before the Shema during the day is, \"Who creates the light and fashions the darkness\". The second blessing is, \"Of unending love, you loved us\". The blessing said after the Shema during the day is, \"True and immutable\". The first blessing before the Shema at night is, \"Who brings on the evening\". The second blessing is, \"The unending love of Your people the House of Israel\". The first blessing after the Shema at night is, \"True and faithful\". The second blessing is, \"Lay us down\".",
            "The first blessing that is before the recitation, whether day or night, starts and ends with \"Blessed\". The rest of the blessings end with, \"Blessed\"; none of them begin with \"Blessed\". These blessings along with the rest of the arranged blessings known to the Jews were amended by Ezra the Scribe and his court. No one is permitted to shorten them or lengthen them. Anywhere that they amended to end with \"Blessed\", no one is permitted to not end [with it]. Anywhere that they amended to not end with \"Blessed\", no one is permitted to end [with it]. Anywhere that they amended to not begin with \"Blessed\", no one is permitted to begin [with it]. Anywhere that they amended to begin [with \"Blessed\"], no one is permitted to not begin [with it]. The basic rule of the matter is whoever changes the set order of blessings that the Sages established, indeed they have made a mistake and must return and say the blessing as proscribed. Anyone who does not say \"True and immutable\" in the morning prayers and \"True and faithful\" in the evening prayers has not fulfilled their duties. ",
            "One who says the second blessing first, whether during the day or the night, or whether concerning the blessings before [the Shema] or the blessings after, has fulfilled [the commandment], as there is no set order of blessings. If, during the morning prayers, one begins with \"Who creates the light\", and ends with \"Who brings on the evening\", one has not fulfilled [the commandment]. But if one begins with \"Who brings on the evening\" and ends with \"Who creates the light\", one has fulfilled [the commandment]. If, during the evening prayers, one begins with \"Who brings on the evening\" and ends with \"Who creates the light\", one has not fulfilled [the commandment]. If one begins with \"Who creates the light\" and ends with \"Who brings on the evening\", one  has fulfilled [the commandment] as all blessings are lead by the ending [blessing]. ",
            "What is the time of the recitation of the Shema at night? The commandment is from the emergence of the stars until [halakhic] midnight. If one transgresses by delaying, one [may] say until dawn to fulfill the duty. The [Sages] stated until midnight so that one is kept from delinquent tardiness.",

            "One who reads the Shma and did not intend one's heart in the first verse, which is \"Hear O Israel,\" did not fulfill her obligation. And the rest [of the Shma], if one didn't intend one's heart, one did fulfill [one's obligation], even if one was reading in the Torah according to one's practice or proofing these sections in the time (season?) of reading, one fulfilled [one's obligation], and that is just if one intended one's heart in the first verse."
