            "[1] A woman may be divorced only by means of a writ that reaches her, and this writ is called a get. According to the Torah, there are ten rules that are basic to divorce, and they are as follows: that the man may not divorce his wife except of his own free will; that he must give a divorce by means of a writ, and not by means of anything else... that it must be written specifically for her... that he must deliver it to her; that he must deliver it to her in the presence of witnesses; that he must give it to her as an instrument of divorce; that it must be the husband, or his agent, who gives it to her...",
            "•\t[2] And from where to we know that these ten rules are derived from the Torah? From this verse (Deuteronomy 24:1) \"[If] she fails to please him, because he finds something unseemly about her, he writes her a bill of divorcement, hands it to her, and sends her away from his house.\"",
            "•\t\"[If] she fails to please him\" implies that he may not give a divorce except of his own free will. If she is divorced against his will, she is not divorced. However a woman may be divorced with her consent as well as without it.",

            "The messenger that is made by the wife to receive a <i>get</i> for her from the hand of her husband is called a receiving messenger. And from when the get reaches the hand of her messenger, she is divorced as if it reached her hand. And it is necessary for him to be designated with two witnesses. And it is necessary for two witnesses to testify on the <i>get</i> reaching the hand of her messenger. And even if they are leaders or one of them is a leader, behold they are [still considered] complete testimony."
