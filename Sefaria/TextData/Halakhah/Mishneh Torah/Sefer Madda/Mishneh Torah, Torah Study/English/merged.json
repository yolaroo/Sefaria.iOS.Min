            "Women and slaves are exempt from studying Torah. But a male minor - his father is obligated to teach him Torah, as it says, \"And you shall teach them to your children, to speak in them\" (Deut 11:19). Women are not obligated to teach their sons, for [only] all who are obligated to study are obligated to teach.  ",
            "Just as a person is obligated to teach his son, so too he is obligated to teach his grandson, as it says, \"And make them known to your children, and to your children's children\" (Deut 4:9). And not just his son and his grandson: rather, there is a command upon each and every wise-man [heb. chacham] in Israel to teach all students, even though they are not his children. As it says, \"And you shall tutor them to your children\" (Deut 6:7) - from an [Oral] Tradition they learned that \"your children\" [here] refers to your students, for students can be called children, as in \"And the children of the prophets left\" (I Kings 2:3).",
            "If so, why was it [i.e. the obligation to teach] commanded in regard to a son and grandson? To give priority to a son over a grandson, and a grandson over the son of a friend.  Also, one is obligated [if need be] to hire a teacher to teach his son, but is only obligated to teach his friend's son at no cost. ",
            "One whose father never taught him is obligated, when he realizes [ed.: not sure how to translate that phrase], to teach himself. As it says, \"and you shall study them, and observe them to do them\" (Deut 5:1). And so you find in every place, that studying precedes doing; for studying leads to doing, but doing does not lead to studying. ",
            "If he needs to study Torah and his son needs study Torah, he precedes his son. But if his son is clever and grasps what he studies better than [the father], than his son takes precedence.  But even though his son takes precedence, he may not refrain [from study] - for just as there is a commandment upon him to teach his son, so he is commanded to teach himself.",
            "A man should always study Torah and then marry a woman.  For if he marries a woman first, his mind will not be available for study. But if his desire overcomes him, such that his heart is not available, he should marry a woman and then learn Torah. ",
            "It is a custom in our country for the teacher of children to take money, the father is obligated to pay for his teachings until he knows how to read the whole written Torah. In a place where it is a custom to take money for teaching the written Torah then it is permitted to do so. But the oral Torah it is is forbidden to teach for money. As it is written: \"Behold, I have taught you laws and statutes, as God commanded me.\" Just like I learnt for free, so to you will be taught for free. Teach the coming generations in a like manner. Teach them at no cost as you have learned from me. If a person cannot find someone to teach him at no cost, he must pay for his studies, as it is written: \"Buy truth.\" May he charge to teach others? We learn: \"but do not sell.\" Thus, it can be derived that it is forbidden to charge to teach Torah even though one's teacher charged to instruct him.",
            "Every Jew is obligated to learn Torah, whether he is poor or rich, whether he has a full and healthy body or whether he is a person who has many trouble, whether he is young or whether he is very old and his strength is weak, even if he is a poor man which supports him self from charity and knocks on each door even if he is a husband of a wife and children he is obligated to have set time to learn Torah in the day and in the night as it is written \"You shall think about it day and night.\" ",
            "Until when is a person obligated to learn Torah? Until the day of his death, as the verse states:  \"Lest you remove it from your heart, all the days of your life.\" The whole time when a person is not learning he is forgetting ",

            "...It is a commandment to praise any disciple of the sages, even if they are not one's master, as it says \"honor the face of an old person\" (Leviticus 19:32). Zaken (old person) [is short for] this one that acquired wisdom (Zeh sheKaNah chochmah). And when are we obligated to stand in front of him? From the moment that he is within four cubits, until he passed in front.",
            "... One does not stand in front of him in the bathhouse or the bathroom, as it says \"stand\" and \"honor\" - a standing where there is honor. And craftsmen are not obligated to stand for disciples of the sages at the moment when they are busy with their work, as it says \"\"standing\" and \"honoring\" - just as honoring does not imply monetary loss, so too standing does not imply monetary loss\" (Talmud Babylonian Kiddushin 32b)  and from where do we know that one does not avert one's eyes from a sage so one won't see him and will not have to stand? From what it says \"'and you shall fear your God' - behold, on all actions that are dependent on one's intention we find written about them 'and you shall fear your God'.",
            "... It does not befit a sage to be burdensome the people and direct them to stand before him, rather he should go through the shorter way and try to make others NOT see him",

            "... A student who always sits in front of his teacher is not permitted to stand in front of him - the exception being the morning and evening prayers, so his honoring [his teacher] won't be greater than his honoring God.",
            "...One should stand in the presence of an extremely old person, even if he is not a scholar. Even a young scholar stands up in the presence of an extremely old person; however, he is not obligated to stand up to his full height, rather [enough] to show deference. We even show deference to an old non-Jew, with [kind] words and a helping hand, as it says: \"You shall rise before the aged...\" (Leviticus 19:32) - any sort of aged [person] is implied.",
