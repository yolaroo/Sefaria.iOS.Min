            "1. There are three ways in which someone enters the covenant: by circumcision, by immersion, and by a Temple offering.",
            "2. Circumcision as it was in Egypt, as it says, \"Every uncircumcised person shall not eat of it (the Passover offering).\"  Moses our teacher circumcised them and everyone spurned the covenant in Egypt with the exception of the Tribe of Levi.  On this it says, \"Your covenant was withheld.\"",
            "3. Immersion was in the desert before receiving the Torah, as is said, \"Sanctify yourselves today and tomorrow; wash your clothes.\"  The offering, as is said, \"Send the young ones of Israel to bring elevation offerings\" - and everyone in Israel brought them.",
            "4. Throughout the generations, any non-Jew who wants to enter the covenant and come in under the 'wings of the Presence of God' accepts upon him or herself the yoke of Torah - he needs circumcision, immersion and a Temple offering.  If female, she needs only immersion and an offering, as is said \"As for you, so for the foreigner.\"  That's to say, just as you (entered via) circumcision, immersion and an offering, so too the foreigner (shall enter via) circumcision, immersion and an offering.",
            "5. What's a convert's offering?  An elevation offering or two doves or two turtledoves (and the two are considered an offering).  At this time in history where there are no offerings, one needs (merely) circumcision and immersion.  Once the Temple is built, one will bring an offering.",
