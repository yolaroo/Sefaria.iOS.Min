            "If the court issued a ruling to violate one of the commandments mentioned in the Torah, and an individual went and accidentally did it because of their instructions, whether they did it and he did it with them, whether they did it and he did it after them, whether they did not do it and he did it, he is exempt because he relied on the court.  If the court issued [such] a ruling and one of them knew that they made a mistake, or a student who is capable of ruling [knew that they made a mistake], and he went and did it because of their instructions, whether they did it and he did it with them, whether they did it and he did it after them, whether they did not do it and he did it, he is liable because he was not relying on the court.  This is the rule: If one relies on himself, he is liable.  If he relies on the court, he is exempt.",
            "If the court issued a ruling and then realized that they made a mistake, whether they brought their atonement-offering or whether they did not [yet] bring their atonement-offering, if an individual went and did it because of their instructions, R. Shimon exonerates him, and R. Eliezer says it is a case of doubt.  What is the case of doubt?  If he was sitting at home, he is liable.  If he traveled across the sea, he is exempt.  R. Akiva said, I grant that in this case, he is closer to being exempt than being liable.  Ben Azzai said to him, what is the difference between this case and one who is sitting in his home?  The one who is sitting at home could have heard [that the court reversed its ruling], but for this one [who traveled far away], he could not have heard.",
            "If the court issued a ruling to uproot an entire section [of the law]; [for example] if they said \"there are no laws of a mestruant in the Torah,\" \"there is no Sabbath in the Torah,\" \"there is no [prohibition of] idolatry in the Torah,\" they (i.e. the members of the court) are exempt.  If they issued a ruling to nullify part and uphold part, they are liable.  What is that case?  If they said \"there are laws of a menstruant in the Torah, but one who has relations with a woman who is 'keeping a day corresponding to a day (i.e. she has already immersed in a Mikvah, and then she sees blood.  She needs to wait a day before relations.)' is exempt,\" \"there is Sabbath in the Torah, but one who carries from private property to public property is exempt,\" \"there is [a prohibition of] idolatry in the Torah, but one who bows to it is exempt,\" [in all these cases] they are liable, as it says \"the thing being hid from the eyes\" (Leviticus 4:13)--a thing and not an entire section.",
            "If the court issued a ruling, and one of the knew that they erred and said to them \"you are mistaken,\" or if the expert of the court (someone who is not a member of the court but is consulted in difficult cases) was not there, or one of them was a convert or a bastard or a \"Netin\" or an aged person who has never had children, they are exempt, as it says \"congregation\" here (Leviticus 4:13) and it says \"congregation\" later on (Numbers 35:24-25).  Just like the \"congregation\" mentioned later on refers to those who are all capable of issuing a ruling, so too, \"congregation\" here refers to those who are all capable of issuing a ruling.  If the court issued a [wrong] ruling by accident, and the whole people did it by accident, they bring a cow [as an offering].  [If the court issued a wrong ruling] on purpose, and [the people] did it by accident, they bring a lamb or a goat.  [If the court issued a wrong ruling] by accident, and [the people] did it on purpose, they are exempt.",
            "If a court promulgated [a law] and the entirety of the congregation or its majority acted accordingly, they bring a cow, and in [a matter of] idol worship, they bring a cow and a sheep: the words of Ribbi Me'ir.  Ribbi Yehudha says: twelve tribes bring twelves cows, and in [a matter of] idol worship, they bring twelve cows and twelve sheep.  Ribbi Shim'on says: thirteen cows, and in [a matter of] idol worship, thirteen cows and thirteen sheep, a cow and a sheep for each and every tribe and a cow and a sheep for the court.  If a court promulgated [ a law] and seven tribes or their majority acted accordingly, they bring a cow, and in [a matter of] idol worship, they bring a cow and a sheep: the words of Ribbi Me'ir.  Ribbi Yehudha says: the seven nations that sinned bring seven cows, and the remaining nations that did not sin bring on their behalf a cow, for even those who did not sin bring on behalf of the sinners.  Ribbi Shim'on says: eight cows, and in [a matter of] idol worship, eight cows and eight sheep, a cow and a sheep for each and every tribe and a cow and a sheep for the court.  If a court from one of the tribes promulgated [a law] and that tribe acted accordingly, that tribe is the one that is obligated and all the remaining tribes are exempt: the words of Ribbi Yehudha.  And the Sages say: We are only obligated on account of a promulgated of the National Court alone, as it says (Leviticus 4:13): \"And if all of the community of Israel errs,\" and not the community of that tribe."

            "If he ruled on his own and acted on his own, he gains atonement on his own.  If he ruled with the community and acted with the community, he gains atonement with the community, for a court is not liable unless they rule to abandon some (commandments) and fulfill some, and so too with the anointed (high priest).  And not (guilty of) idolatry unless they rule to abandon some and fulfill some.",
            "One is not obligated except for a lack of awareness with a mistaken action, and also the anointed Cohen. Also by idol worship, one is not obligated except for a lack of awareness with a mistaken action. A court is not obligated until they rule on something that if done purposefully is obligated kares, and accidentally is obligated a chatas. So too by an anointed Cohen. And not by idol worship, until you rule on something that if done purposefully is obligated kares and accidentally a chatas.",
            "One is not obligated on (transgression of) a positive or a negative (precept) in the Temple, and one does not bring a guilt offering on (transgression of) a positive or negative (precept) in the Temple. However one is obligated on (transgression of) a positive or negative (precept) in the (laws of) Niddah, and one does bring a guilt offering on (transgression of) a positive or negative (precept) in the (laws of) Niddah. What is a positive precept in the (laws of) Niddah, (be) separate from the Niddah. And a negative precept, do not come near the Niddah.",
            "[The court] is not obligated for [mistakes regarding] hearing a public charge [see Leviticus 5:1], for a thoughtless oath, or for the impurity of the Temple and its consecrated things. The Nasi is simila in this, so says Rabbi Yose Haglili. Rabbi Akiva says, The Nasi is obligated in all of them, except for hearing a public charge [which requires him to testify], for a king cannot judge nor be judged, nor [can a king] testify, nor can others testify [against him].",
            "All commandments in the Torah for which one is liable if done purposefully karet* and if done mistakenly a sin offering, an individual brings a female sheep and a female goat.  The prince brings a male goat.  The anointed (priest) or the court bring a bull.  With idolatry, an individual, a prince, and an anointed (priest) bring a female goat and the court brings a bull and a male goat-- the bull for a burnt offering and the goat for a sin offering.",
            "A suspended guilt-offering [when one is unsure if he did a sin], the individual and the Nasi are obligated [to sacrifice], but the anointed [high priest] and the Court are exempt. A definite guilt-offering, the individual, the Nasi, and the annointed [high priest] are obligated, but the Court is exempt. On [mistakes regarding] ignoring a public charge, or thoughtless oaths, or impurity of the Temple and its consecrated things, the Court is exempt, and the individual, the Nasi, and the anointed [high priest] are obligated, but the High Priest us not obligated for the impurity of the Temple and its consercated things, these are the words of Rabbi Shimon. And what would they bring? A sacrifice dependent on income. Rabbi Eliezer said, a Nasi brings a goat."

[If it become known] after the appointment, they are exempt. Which leader is this? This is the king, as it says (Leviticus 4:22): \"And did one of the commandments of God,\" because there is no one above [the king] besides God.",
            "Who is the anointed [discussed above]? The one anointed with the oil of anointing, not the one with many clothes. There is no difference between the anointed with the oil of anointing and the one with many clothes is the bull offered for [the violation of] any of the commandments. There is no difference between the acting and retired priest, except for the bull of the Day of Atonement and the tenth of an <i>eiphah</i>. They are the same in the service of the Day of Atonement, are commanded to [marry] a virgin, are forbidden to [marry] a widow, do not defile themselves for relatives, do not let their hair grow long, do not tear their clothing, and allow the unintentional killer to return [to his home, by their death].",
            "A High Priest tears [his garments] from below, and a common [priest tears his garments] from below. A High Priest brings offerings as a mourner but does not eat [the sacrificial meat], while a common [priest] does not bring offerings or eat [the sacrificial meat as a mourner].",
            "Anything which is more common than its peer supersedes its peer.  Anything which is holier than its peer supersedes its peer.  The bull of the anointed and the bull of the community standing (together), the bull of the anointed supersedes the bull of the community in all its processes.",

When?  If they are all equal.  However, if the descendant of a forbidden relation is a sage and the high priest is a commoner, the descendant of a forbidden relation who is a sage supersedes the high priest who is a commoner."
