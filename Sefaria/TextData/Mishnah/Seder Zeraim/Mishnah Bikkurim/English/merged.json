            "Some bring <i>Bikkurim</i> [first-fruits that must be brought to the Temple in Jerusalem and given to the <i>Kohen</i>, priest] and recite [the accompanying Biblical passage], some bring but do not recite, and some do not bring. These are who do not bring: one who plants in ones's own property but [the tree] leans into [another's] private or public property, and similarly, if [the tree] leans from a private or public property into one's own property. One who plants in one's own property and there are private or public roads that are planted in the middle does not bring. Rabbi Judah says, in that case, one does bring.",
            "For what reason does one not bring? For it says (Exodus 23:19), \"The first fruits of your land\" [implying], all that is grown must be entirely from your land. Sharecroppers, renters, <i>Sikrikonim</i> [those who forced another to give up land at the threat of death], and thieves do not bring for the same reason, for it says, \"The first fruits of your land.\"",
            "One only brings <i>Bikkurim</i> from the seven species [special to the Land of Israel, listed in Deut. 8:8], [but] not from the dates of the mountains or from fruits of the valley, nor from oil-olives that are not of the highest quality. One does not bring <i>Bikkurim</i> before the Festival [of <i>Shavuot</i>, the harvest holiday 50 days after Passover]. People from Har Tsevo'im brought their <i>Bikkurim</i> and they [the priests] did not accept [the fruits] because of the verse in the Torah, (Exodus 23:16) \"And the harvest festival, the first fruits of your labor that you plant in the field.\"",
            "These people bring, but do not recite: the convert brings but does not recite, for he is unable to say [in the Biblical recitation] \"[the land] that God swore to our fathers to give to us.\" And if his mother was from Israel, he brings and recites. And when he prays by himself, he says [in place of, \"the God of our fathers\"] \"the God of the fathers of Israel.\" And when he is in the synagogue, he says \"the God of your fathers.\" And if his mother was from Israel, he says \"the God of our fathers.\"",
            "Rabbi Eli'ezer ben Ya'akov says, a woman who is the daughter of converts cannot marry into the <i>Kohen</i> class, unless her mother is an Israelite; [this ruling applies to] both converts and freed slaves, and even after ten generations [from the original convert/freed slave], until their mother is an Israelite. A trustee of an estate, an agent, a slave, a woman, a <i>Tumtum</i> [person of unidentifiable sex] and an <i>Androgynos</i> [an intersex person] all bring but do not recite, since they cannot say, \"[the land] that You, God, have given me.\"",
            "One who buys two trees in [the field] of a fellow, brings but does not recite. Rabbi Meir says, one brings and recites. If the spring dried or the tree was chopped, one brings but does not recite. Rabbi Judah says, one brings and recites. From the Festival [of <i>Shavuot</i>] until <i>Sukkot</i> [the third pilgrimage festival in the fall], one brings and recites. From <i>Sukkot</i> until Hanukkah, one brings but does not recite. Rabbi Judah ben Beteira says, one brings and recites.",
            "One who designated one's <i>Bikkurim</i> and [subsequently] sold one's field, brings and does not recite. And the second [one who bought the field] does not bring more from that same species. From a different species, one brings and recites. Rabbi Judah says, even from the same species one brings and recites.",
            "One who designated one's <i>Bikkurim</i> [and then] they were looted or rotted or were stolen or lost or became ritually impure, one then brings others in their place and does not recite. The second ones are not obligated in the <i>Chomesh</i> [the penalty of an additional fifth added to the repayment of one who accidentally ate sanctified food]. If they became ritually impure within the <i>Azarah</i> [the Temple courtyard], they are destroyed and one does not recite.",
            "And from where (do we know) that one is liable for their safekeeping until one brings them to the Temple Mount? Because it says (Exodus 23:19), \"The first fruits of your land you must bring to the house of the LORD Your God\"; this teaches that one is liable for their safekeeping until one brings them to the Temple Mount. One who brings from one species and recites, and then returns and brings another species, does not recite.",
            "These are brought and recited over: [fruit] from <i>Shavuot</i> until <i>Sukkot</i>, from the seven species, from fruit in the mountains, from dates in the valleys, from oil-olives [even from] on the other side of the Jordan River. Rabbi Yose the Galilean says, we do not bring first fruits from the other side of the Jordan since it is not \"the land flowing with milk and honey\" [that the verse describes].",
            "One who buys three trees in a fellow's property, brings and recites. Rabbi Meir says, even two [trees]. One who bought the tree and its ground brings and recites. Rabbi Judah says, even sharecroppers and renters bring and recite. "

            "<i>Terumah</i> [a portion of a crop given to a <i>Kohen</i>, priest; pl. <i>Kohanim</i>, which becomes holy upon separation, and can only be consumed by <i>Kohanim</i> or their household] and <i>Bikkurim</i> [first-fruits that must be brought to the Temple in Jerusalem and given to the <i>Kohen</i>] are subject to the [laws of the] death penalty [if a non-<i>Kohen</i> deliberately consumes them] and the <i>Chomesh</i> [the penalty of an additional fifth added to the repayment of one who accidentally ate sanctified food], and they are forbidden to non-<i>Kohanim</i>, and they are the property of the <i>Kohen</i>, and they are neutralized in one hundred and one [of non-sanctified foodstuff], and they require hand-washing [before handling] and [a <i>Kohen</i> who became impure and then immersed himself to become pure again may eat them only] after sunset.  The above is all for <i>Terumah</i> and <i>Bikkurim</i>, and not for <i>Ma'aser</i> [<i>Sheni</i>, the second tithe of produce, which must be taken to Jerusalem and consumed there].",
            "<i>Ma'aser</i> and <i>Bikkurim</i> share [laws] which are lacking in <i>Terumah</i>: that <i>Ma'aser</i> and <i>Bikkurim</i> must be brought to a [specific] place, require verbal recitation, and are prohibited to an <i>Onen</i> [a person whose close relative has died but has not yet been buried]. Rabbi Shim'on permits in this case.  They both require removal (Rabbi Shim'on doesn't require it).  Any bit of them [when mixed with normal food] eaten in Jerusalem is prohibited.  Any growth which comes from them may not be eaten in Jerusalem, nor by a non-Jew, nor an animal (Rabbi Shim'on permits in these cases).  All these qualities are true for <i>Ma’aser</i> and Bikkurim, but not for <i>Terumah</i>.",
            "<i>Terumah</i> and <i>Ma’aser</i> share qualities which are lacking in Bikkurim; namely, that <i>Terumah</i> and <i>Ma’aser</i>'s threshing-floor remains are prohibited; they have a specified amount to be given; they are taken from all produce, both in Temple times and in post-Temple times; they are applied to produce of rentors, lessors, those who have seized property, and thieves.  All these qualities are true for <i>Terumah</i> and <i>Ma’aser</i>, but not for <i>Bikkurim</i>.",
            "<i>Bikkurim</i> has qualities that neither <i>Terumah</i> nor <i>Ma’aser</i> have; namely, that <i>Bikkurim</i> can be designated while still in the ground; a person may make their entire field into Bikkurim; one would be liable for their replacements; they require a sacrifice, waving, and staying over in Jerusalem.",
            "<i>Terumat Ma’aser</i> (the part of the tithe given to a Levite that the Levite must give to a priest) is similar to <i>Bikkurim</i> in two ways, and to <i>Terumah</i> in two ways.  It may be taken from pure produce to [permit] unpure produce [to be eaten], and [it may be taken] from produce that is not in proximity [to the produce it is making permissible], like <i>Bikkurim</i>.  And it makes what is on the threshing floor forbidden [before it is separated], and it has a required amount, like <i>Terumah</i>.",
            "An Etrog is [halachically considered] like a fruit tree in three ways, and like a vegetable in one.  Its like a fruit tree in that it necessitates Orlah and the laws of the fourth year, as well as Shemitta.  Its like a vegetable in one way, in that its <i>Ma’aser</i> time is determined by when it is picked - these are the words of Rabban Gamliel.  Rabbi Eliezer says, its like a fruit tree in all ways.",
            "Human blood is like animal blood regarding the laws of agricultural impurity, and like insect blood in that it doesn't render one impure [in the Temple].",
            "A koy is like a wild animal in some ways, and like a domestic animal in other ways, and like both in some ways, and like neither in other ways.",
            "How is it like a wild animal? [If slaughtered], its blood must be buried like that of a wild animal; it may not be slaughtered on Yom Tov - and if slaughtered then, the blood should not be covered.  Its prohibited fats cause impurity through \"N'veila impurity\" like a wild animal; its impurity is doubtful.  It cannot be redeemed through the redemption of a donkey.",
            "How is it like a domesticated animal? Its prohibited fats are prohibited like that of a domesticated animal, while eating of it doesn't induce Karet; it cannot be purchased with tithe money to be eaten in Jerusalem; the Kohanim are entitled to its shank, cheeks, and stomach.  Rabbi Eliezer exempts this, due to the law that if one possesses an item, it is incumbent on the other [who desires it] to prove his claim to it.",
            "How is it unlike both a wild animal and a domesticated animal?  It is forbidden to mate it or yoke it with a wild animal and with a domesticated animal (see Leviticus 19:19 and Deuteronomy 22:10).  If one writes that his wild animal or domesticated animal will pass to his son, he did not write over the Koy.  If one said \"I shall be a Nazirite if it is a wild animal,\" or [he says \"I shall be a Nazirite if it is] a domesticated animal,\" he becomes a Nazirite.  And in all other matters, it is equal to a wild animal and to a domesticated animal, and requires ritual slaughter like both of them, and its corps defiles (see Leviticus 11:8), and [one is liable for] eating a limb taken from it while it is still alive like both of them.

            "How does one designate for first fruits?  A man goes to his field and sees a date which is bearing fruit, a bunch (of grapes) which is bearing fruit, or a pomegranate which is bearing fruit-- he ties it with a string and says, \"This is first fruit.\"  Rabbi Shimon says: even still, he reiterates and declares them first fruits once they have been picked.",
            "How do they bring the first fruits up?  All the cities around the big city would go into the big city and sleep in the streets of that city without going into the houses. When they arose the supervisor would say, \"Arise!  Let us go up to Zion, to the house of YHVH our God!\"",
            "Those who were close would bring dates and grapes and the far ones would bring dried figs and raisins. A bull would go before them and its horns would be plated with gold and it would have a olive wreath around its head.  The flute would play before them until they got close to Jerusalem.  Once they got close to Jerusalem, they sent before them and arranged their first fruits.  The overseers and the officers and the treasurers would go out to greet them-- in accordance with the stature of those coming in would they go out.  All the artisans of Jerusalem would stand before them and greet them, \"Our brothers from XYZ place, you have come in peace!\"",
            "The flute would continue playing before them until they arrived at the Temple Mount.  Once they arrived at the Temple Mount, even Agripas the King would carry his basket on his shoulder and enter until he reached the courtyard.  Once they got to the courtyard, the Levites would speak in poetry (Psalms 30:2): I will extol you, YHVH, because you have raised me and not allowed my enemies to rejoice over me.",
            "The young birds on the baskets were olah offerings.  And what was in their hands, they gave to the kohanim.",
            "With the basket still on his shoulder, he recites from \"I declare today to YHVH my God\" (Deuteronomy 26:3-10) until the end of the subject.  Rabbi Judah says until \"My father was a wandering Aramean.\"  Once he gets to \"My father was a wandering Aramean\", he takes the basket off his shoulder and holds it by its lip.  The priest places his hand under it and waves it.  He then recites from \"My father was a wandering Aramean\" until the end of the subject and rests (the basket) beside the altar and prostrates and leaves.",
            "In the beginning, anyone who knew how to read would read.  Anyone else would have it read for him.  People were reticent to bring and they declared that it would be read for those who know how to read and those who do not.",
            "Wealthy people brought their first fruits in baskets of silver and of gold.  Poor people brought theirs in baskets of woven willow stems.  Both the baskets and the fruits were given to the priests.",
            "Rabbi Shimon ben Nanas said, [one may] decorate the first fruits [with species] outside of the seven species.  Rabbi Akiva said, only decorate the first fruits with the seven species.",
            "Rabbi Shimon says: there are three categories in first fruits; the first fruits, the addition to the first fruits, and the decoration of the first fruits. The addition to the first fruits are from the same species.  The decoration of the first fruits is from a different species.  The addition to the first fruits are eaten in ritual purity, and aren't obligated in 'damai'.  The decoration of the first fruits are obligated in 'damai'.",
            "In what case do we say that the addition to the first fruits is like the first fruits?  When it comes from the land.  If it doesn't come from the land, it's not like the first fruits.",
            "Why do we say that the first fruits are like the property of a kohen?  Because he can buy with them slaves, land, or an impure animal, and a creditor takes them to pay a debt, and a women takes them to pay her ketubah, like a Torah scroll.  And Rabbi Yehudah says they are only given to a friend as a gift.  The wisemen say they are given to the people of the watch, and they divide them amongst themselves, like the sanctified meat of the temple."
