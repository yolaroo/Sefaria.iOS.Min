            "Cucumbers and melons are not kilaim. R. Jehudah saith they are. Lettuce and cabbage-lettuce are not kilaim; neither are endive and wild succory; nor common [garden] leek and wild leek; nor common coriander and wild coriander; nor common mustard and Egyptian mustard; nor Egyptian pumpkins and bitter pumpkins; nor Egyptian beans and pod-beans.",
            "Turnips and rape [turnip radishes] are not kilaim; neither are cabbage and [wild] colewort, nor ‏תְּרָדִים‎ 4 and ‏לְעוֹנִים‎. R. Akivah adds, neither are common garlic and wild garlic; nor onions and shalots; nor ‏תּוֹרְמוֹם‎ and ‏פַּלְסוּם‎.",
            "Among the [fruits of] trees, pears and crustumina are not kilaim; nor are quinces and medlars. The apple and crab apple, apricots and almonds, plums and pistachios, although similar [in flavour] are, nevertheless, kilaim.",
            "Radishes and rape, mustard and lapsano, Greek and Egyptian pumpkins [together] and bitter pumpkins, although similar, are, nevertheless, kilaim.",
            "The wolf and the dog, the fox and the fox-hound, goats and deer, sheep and chamois, the horse and the mule, the mule and the ass, the ass and the zebra, although similar, are kilaim.",
            "[The fruits of] trees must not be grafted on trees of a different kind; nor [one kind of] shrub, [plant or herb] on another kind of shrub; nor yet [scions of] trees on shrubs, nor shrubs on trees. R. Jehudah permits the grafting of shrubs on trees.",
            "Shrubs must not be planted on a sycamore-bush; rue must not be grafted on white cassia, because that [would be a shrub] on a tree; a scion of figs must not be planted among ‏חֲצוּב‎ to cool it; a vine-branch must not be sunk [trained] into a melon-bed, to instil its juices therein, because that is a tree on a plant; pumpkin-seed must not be set among mallow, in order that it may be preserved therein, as that is herb in herb.",
            "If turnips and radishes be hidden [in the ground] beneath a vine, so that part of the leaves are visible, man need not feel any hesitation [to use them], either on the score of kilaim or of the 7th [sabbatical] year, nor yet of tithes; and they [the turnips and radishes] may be taken [out of the ground] on the Sabbath-day. If wheat and barley be sown at once [together], that forms kilaim. R. Jehudah saith, \"Kilaim are not formed unless two kinds of wheat be sown to one of barley, or two kinds of barley to one of wheat; or wheat, barley, and spelt, be sown together.\""

            "If in a saah 1 of seed-corn there is one-fourth [of a kab] of any other kind of seed, the [last mentioned] quantity must be diminished. R. Jose saith, \"Whether this quarter of a kab consist of one [different kind of] seed, or of two [kinds], it must be picked out of the saah.\" R. Simeon saith, \"This rule [that the quantity of different seeds intermingled among a saah of seed-corn, must be diminished if it amount to one-fourth of a kab] holds good only when the whole quarter of a kab is of one kind.\" But the sages hold, that whatever of kilaim is mixed among a saah of seed-corn, must all be included in the computation of the quarter of a kab.",
            "To what does this rule apply? To grain of one kind mixed among grain of other kinds; to legumes mixed among legumes; also to grain [mixed] among legumes, and to legumes mixed among grain. They [the sages] laid it down as a rule, that all kinds of non-edible garden seeds, are subject to the computation of kilaim, provided they reach the proportion of one twenty-fourth part of the total quantity of seed-corn required to sow a Beth-Saah. R. Simeon saith, \"As in this instance they [the sages] are more rigid, so in another instance they alleviate [the observance], inasmuch as flaxseed mixed among corn, is also subject to the computation of kilaim only when it reaches the proportion of one twenty-fourth part to the Beth-Saah.",
            "If a man having sown his field with wheat changes his mind, and determines to sow it with barley, he must tarry till the first sown seed has germinated [is dissolved in the ground], then he must plough up the field before he may sow the fresh seed; if the wheat [first sown] has sprung up, he is not to say, \"I will first sow [the barley], and then plough up my field,\" but he must plough up first, and afterwards sow. To what extent is he bound to plough up his field? To the depth of the furrows for the early rain. Abbah Saul saith, \"so that in a field of the size of a Beth-Saah there remain not the space [equal to receive] one-fourth kab of seed-corn [unploughed].\"",
            "If a man, having sown his field, change his mind, and determine to plant thereon, he must not say, \"I will first plant and then plough up my field,\" but he must plough un first and afterwards plant. If, having planted his field, he change his mind, and determine to sow on it, he must not say, \"I will first sow my field, and then root up what I have planted,\" but he must first uproot, and then sow. But, if he like, he may cut down the stalks of the plants till within [less than] a hand high from the ground; he then sows, and, lastly, uproots what he has planted.",
            "If his field has been sown with carraway, or ‏לוף‎, he must not sow any thing over them, as these two kinds do not spring up [ripen] till after three years. If sprouts of isatis have sprung up among corn, or if various kinds of seed have sprung up in the ground of a barn, or if fœnum Græcum spring up, of various kinds, a man is not bound to weed them out; but if he has commenced to weed out or cut down any of them, he is [in that case] bound to destroy all except one kind only.",
            "If a man wishes to cultivate his field in patches [streaks or plots], set with different kinds [of seeds or plants], what distance is he bound to leave between the respective plots? Beth Shammai hold, \"the distance of three furrows;\" Beth Hillel hold, \"the width of a yoke, such as is used in plains.\" Both opinions, however, approximate very closely.",
            "There is no legal objection if the point of the angle of [a field sown with] wheat enter into a field of barley; as any one can see to which field the angle belongs. If a man's field be sown with wheat, and the adjoining field of his neighbour with some other kind, there is no objection to his sowing the same kind [of seed] that his neighbour has sown, close to the adjoining field. If his own field be sown with wheat, and the adjoining one of his neighbour likewise, there is no objection to his sowing a furrow [row] of flax between them, but he must not sow any other kind. R. Simeon saith, \"Flax forms no exception from other kinds [and is consequently prohibited];\" but R. José saith, \"Even in the midst of his own field a man may sow a furrow [row] of flax by way of experiment.\"",
            "Mustard or wild saffron must not be sown adjoining a cornfield; but they may be sown adjoining a meadow; also adjoining a field which lies fallow, or one that has been newly ploughed up; also next to a stone wall, or a footpath, or a hedge [fence] ten hands high; or to a trench [ditch], ten hands deep and four hands wide; or next to a tree which trails its branches along the ground; or to a rock [stone] ten hands high and for hands broad.",
            "If a man wishes to divide his field into square plots sown with, different kinds of seed, he must apportion it into twenty-four squares to the beth saah of seed corn, one square to each quarter of a kab, and he may then sow whatever kind of seed he pleases into each [separate] square. If there be one or two such squares [in a cornfield], a man may sow mustard-seed in them; but if three [such squares] adjoining each other are in a field of corn, he must not sow mustard-seed on them, as the plot of ground would seem to be a mustard field. Such is the dictum of R. Meir; but the sages say, \"Nine such squares may be sown with mustard-seed, but ten may not [are prohibited].\" R. Eleazar ben Jacob saith, \"Though the field be of size sufficient to receive an entire kur of seed, not more than one square must be made in it.\"",
            "Whatever forms part of the superficies of a field, and is of size sufficient to receive a quarter kab of seed, must be included in the computation of the quarter kab. Thus the space round a vine, or a grave, or a rock [stone], must be included in the computation of the quarter kab. [One kind of] corn must be sown [at the distance of] one quarter kab area from [another kind of] corn. Herbs [at the distance of] six hands from other herbs. Corn from herbs, or herbs from corn, [must be sown at the distance of] one quarter of a kab. R. Eleazar saith, \"herbs from corn, at the distance of six hands only.\"",
            "One kind of corn inclining over [standing higher than] another kind of corn, or one kind of herbs over another, or corn over herbs, or herbs over corn, are all permitted, except Greek pumpkins. R. Meir saith, \"excepting also cucumbers and Egyptian beans; nevertheless I prefer their opinion [that of the sages] to mine own.\""

            "In a garden bed that is six hands square, five different kinds of seed may be sown, namely, four kinds in the four corners of the bed, and the fifth in the centre. If the bed has a ridge [border], thirteen different kinds may be sown; three in each corner, and one in the middle of the bed; but turnip-tops must be sown on the ridge [border] as they fill it. R. Jehudah saith, \"six different kinds [may be sown in the middle of the field].\"",
            "All kinds of field seeds must not be sown in a garden bed; but all kind of herbs [garden seed] may be sown therein. Mustard and small peas are field seeds. Camel [large] peas are garden seed. A ridge [border] that had been one hand high, but is decreased in height, still remains [within the meaning and benefit of the law], because originally it had been of lawful height. In a trench or dry kennel, one hand deep, three different kinds of seed may be sown; namely, one [kind] on each side, and one [kind] in the middle.",
            "There is no legal objection, if the point of the angle of a field sown with herbs, enter into another herb field, because any one can see to which field the angle appertains. If, in a field sown with herbs of one kind, a man wishes to set one row of herbs of another species, R. Ishmael saith, \"This can only be done if the open furrow [which separates the two kinds of herbs] traverse the whole length of the field [from top to bottom]. R. Akivah saith, \"it [the furrow] needs but be six hands long, but must be as wide as it is deep.\" R. Jehudah saith, \"it [the furrow] must be as wide as the sole of a man's foot.\"",
            "It is lawful for a man to set two rows of cucumbers, two rows of pumpkins, and two rows of Egyptian beans, [a furrow separating each kind from the other]; but a single row of cucumbers, one of pumpkins, and one of Egyptian beans, is prohibited. One row of cucumbers, one of pumpkins, one of Egyptian beans, and [then again] a row of cucumbers, are, according to R. Eleazar, permitted; but, according to the sages, prohibited.",
            "A man may plant cucumbers and pumpkins in the same cavity [hollow], provided that each kind incline towards its own side [of the cavity]. (Another reading has: \"Care must, however, be taken, that the leaves of each kind incline toward its own side only; for all that the sages prohibited in this respect they did on the score of outward appearance only.\")",
            "If a man's field have been set with onions, and he wish to plant rows of pumpkins in it, R. Ishmael saith, He must pull up [onions sufficient to make room for] two rows [of pumpkins], and [in the middle of that vacant space] he plants one row [of pumpkins]; he then leaves a plot of onions [equal to the] space [occupied by] two rows of pumpkins, and then [again pulls up onions sufficient to make room for] two rows [of pumpkins], in the middle of which space [he again] sows one row of pumpkins, [and so on alternately. But R. Akivah saith, \"he pulls up [onions sufficient to make room for] two rows [of pumpkins] he then plants [these] two rows of pumpkins, leaves a plot of onions equal to the space occupied by two rows of pumpkins, and then again pulls up onions sufficient to make room for two rows of pumpkins, which [two rows] he sets in the vacant space, [and so on alternately].\" But the sages say, \"Unless there is a space of twelve cubits between each row of pumpkins, he is not permitted to let that which is between [the two rows] remain in the ground.\"",
            "Pumpkins [may be] planted next to garden seed, [as they] are likewise considered as a garden plant; but if [they are] planted next to corn, a space must be left fallow, of size sufficient to receive one quarter kab of seed corn. If, in a field sown with corn, it is wished to set one row of pumpkins, a clear space of six hands wide must be allowed for its cultivation: should it spread, the corn must be pulled up to make room for it. R. Jose saith: \"a clear space, four amoth wide, must be left for its cultivation.\" They [the sages] objected, [saying], \"Does this species [pumpkins] require greater rigour than the vine does?\" but he, [R. José], replied, \"We do find that this species [pumpkins] exacts a more- rigorous observance than the vine: for a single vine requires that a clear space, six hands wide, be allowed for its cultivation; whereas a single pumpkin must have a clear space, equal to a quarter kab, allowed for that purpose.\" R. Meir said, on the authority of R. Ishmael, \"Whenever three [Greek] pumpkins are set in a field equal to a saah of seed corn, no other kind of seed must be sown [within that area].\" R. Jose ben Hahoteph Ephrati said, on the authority of R. Ishmael, \"If three [Greek] pumpkins are set in a field large enough to hold a kur [of seed corn], no other kind of seed may be sown within that area.\""

            "A bald plot of vineyard must, according to Beth Shammai, \"measure twenty-four square amoth;\" and, according to Beth Hillel, \"sixteen square amoth of any other kind of seed is to be sown therein.\" The exterior space of the vineyard [independent of the plot in question], must, according to Beth Shammai, \"measure sixteen;\" and, according to Beth Hillel, \"twelve square amoth.\" What is [understood] by [the expression], a bald plot of vineyard? Such part of the vineyard as is bare of vines. If it be less than sixteen square amoth, no other kind of seed may be sown therein; but if it measure that superficies, a sufficient vacancy is allowed for the cultivation of the vines growing near it, and the rest [of the ground] may be sown on.",
            "What is [meant by the expression], the exterior space of the vineyard? The space between the vineyard, [the ground on which the vines are set], and the fence [hedge which surrounds it]. If that space be less than twelve square amoth, no other seed is to be sown therein; but if it measure that superficies, a vacant space must be allowed for the cultivation of the vines growing near it, and the rest [of the ground] may be sown on.",
            "R. Jehudah saith, \"This [last-mentioned space] is only the fence of the vineyard. What then does actually constitute the exterior space [in question]? The angle between two vineyards. What is understood by the expression, a fence? A hedge ten hands high, or a trench [ditch], ten hands deep and four wide.\"",
            "A partition [wall] of canes is considered a fence, provided the space between each cane be less than three hands wide, so that a young kid cannot pass through the opening. If there be a breach in the fence to the extent of ten amoth, it is considered as a gate [entrance]. Should a greater portion of the fence be broken down [than ten hands wide], it is unlawful to sow or plant towards [in] the breach. If there are several breaches in the fence, should the portion still standing [erect] be greater than that broken down, it is permitted; but should the portion broken down be greater than that standing [erect], it is prohibited [to plant or sow in or towards the breaches].",
            "If a man set five vines in a single row, that, according to Beth Shammai, \"forms a vineyard;\" whereas, according to Beth Hillel, \"a vineyard is not formed by less than two rows.\" [Consequently], if a man sow [any kind of seed] within the four amoth [next adjoining the vines], Beth Shammai hold, \"that he has consecrated [rendered the produce unlawful], if there be one row of vines;\" whereas Beth. Hillel hold \"that he has not consecrated [rendered the produce unlawful] unless there be two rows of vines.\"",
            "If two vines be set so as to face two vines, and the fifth to form a tail, [point or angle], (thus,  ), they constitute a vineyard. Two vines facing two vines, and one vine between three, (thus,  ), or two facing two, and one in the middle, (thus, ), do not constitute a vineyard, as that can only be formed by two facing two, and the fifth [vine] standing out [as a tail or angle].",
            "If a man have planted one row of vines on his own ground, and there be another row on the adjoining field of his neighbour, should there be [between the two rows] a private footpath or a public thoroughfare, or a fence less than ten hands high, the two rows must be [considered as] joined, [forming one vineyard]; but if the fence be higher than ten hands, the two rows are not to be [considered as] joined. R. Jehudah saith, \"If the vines be trained above the fence they must be [considered as] joined [forming one vineyard].",
            "If a man plant two rows of vines, [two in each row], he must not sow any seed in the clear vacant space between them, unless that be eight amoth wide. If he has planted three [such] rows, he must not sow any seed in the clear vacant space between them, unless that be sixteen amoth wide. R. Eleazar ben Jacob said, on the authority of Hananiah ben Hakinai, \"Even though the central row should have been destroyed, man must not sow any seed in the clear [vacant space] between the remaining [two] rows, unless it be sixteen amoth wide; although, had but two rows been planted at first, the vacant interval need only have been eight amoth wide.\"",
            "If a man have planted his vineyard at intervals of sixteen amoth, he is at liberty to sow any kind of seed in it. R. Jehudah said, \"It happened at Zalmon, that a man had set his vineyard at intervals of sixteen amoth. One year he trained the branches of every two rows in one direction, and sowed in the opposite direction; and the next year he trained the branches in another direction, and sowed on the ground that had lain fallow: The matter was brought before the sages, and they sanctioned [his manner of proceeding].\" R. Meir and R. Simeon say, \"He who sets his vineyard at intervals of eight amoth, is also at liberty to sow in it.\""

            "A vineyard that has been destroyed, but still contains ten vines [from which grapes may be gathered], planted in regular order on a superficies large enough to receive a saah of seed-corn, such a vineyard is called a poor vineyard. Should the vines therein be planted irregularly, as long as there remain two vines [set in due order] facing three, it still continues a vineyard in a legal sense, but if not, it is [in law] a vineyard no more. R. Meir saith, \"As long as it retains the appearance of a vineyard it remains one [in a legal sense].\"",
            "A vineyard [in which the vines are] planted, at less intervals than four amoth, R. Simeon declares to be no vineyard [in a legal sense]; but the sages decide that it is a vineyard [in law], but that the vacant space [between the vines] must be considered as non-existing.",
            "Should a trench ten hands deep and four wide traverse the vineyard, R. Eleazar ben Jacob saith, \"if it be open from one end of the vineyard to the other, it must be considered as if running between two vineyards, and may be sown in; but if not, it must be considered as a vinepress.\" Now, respecting a vinepress ten hands deep and four wide, R' Eleazar holds that it is lawful to sow therein, but the sages declare it not lawful. On a mound [barbican] ten hands high and four hands wide, [situated] in a vineyard, it is lawful to sow; but if the branches [of the vine] be trained or entwined over it, it is unlawful [to sow thereon].",
            "If a vine be planted in a vinepress, or a cavity, sufficient space is to be allowed for its cultivation, and the remainder [of the soil] may be sown in. R' Yose says, \"If there be less than four amoth space, no other kind of seed may be sown therein.\" It is permitted to sow in a house that stands in a vineyard.",

If the vines be set at intervals of four or five amoth: but if they are set at intervals of six or seven amoth, he has only consecrated a radius of sixteen cubits in every direction of a circle, but not of a square.",

            "If a marl, going through his vineyard, has accidentally dropped seeds therein, or if they have got in with the manure or the water, or the wind has wafted seeds backward into the vineyard, and they have sprung up, it is not unlawful; but if the wind has carried seeds forward into the vineyard, R. Akivah saith, \"if the seeds have sprouted, he must plough up the ground; if they be shot up into ears of corn, he must knock the grain out of the ears; but if the corn be ripe, it must be burned.\"",
            "If a man permit thorns to stand in his vineyard, R. Eleazar saith, \"he hath [thereby] consecrated his vineyard [rendered its produce unlawful]:\" but the sages say he has not; inasmuch as the vineyard becomes subject to the prohibition only, though [by means of] such seeds or herbs as it is customary to grow in a vineyard; ‏אִרוּם‎ 1 ‏קִיסוּם‎ 2 and the king's lily, and, in general, all kinds of field herbs are not kilaim in a vineyard; hemp is, according to R.

            "What is meant by ‏עָרִים‎ [a kind of espalier on which vines are trained]? When a row of five vines is planted near a hedge [wall] ten hands high, or near the side of a trench [ditch or cavity] ten hands deep and four wide, in that case, four amoth must be left for the cultivation of each vine, which [space] must, according to Beth Shammai, \"be measured from the stem of the vine towards the field [ground];\" but according to Beth Hillel, \"from the hedge to the field.\" R. Jochanan ben Nourie saith, \"Whosoever adopts either of these opinions is in error; for the Law is—If there be a space of four amoth from the stem of the vine to the hedge [or trench], the room necessary for the due cultivation of the vine must be allowed [for that purpose] and the remainder of the ground may be sown on.\" What constitutes the room [space] necessary for the due cultivation of the vine? Six hands in every direction. R. Akivah saith, \"three hands only are required [in every direction].\"",

R. Eleazar saith, \"If a man has planted one row of vines on the even ground, and another row on the steps of a terrace, should the terrace have an elevation of ten hands from the ground, the two rows need not be considered as connected; but they must be so considered if the height of the terrace be less than ten hands.",

It once happened that R. Joshua came to R. Ishmael, in the village Aziz, when R. Ishmael shewed him a vine which had been trained over part of a fig-tree, and asked, \"May I sow under the remaining parts of the tree?\" R. Joshua replied, \"[You may]; it is lawful.\" He then took R. Joshua to a place called Beth Hamaganya, and shewed him a vine trained over a thick bough [or arm] of a sycamore-tree, from which many other boughs branched out, [and repeated the question], when R. Joshua decided that it was only unlawful to sow under the particular bough on which the vine had been trained; but that under all the other boughs it was lawful [to sow].",

Meir saith, \"Excepting only the olive and the fig-tree, all [other] trees are called ‏אִילָן סְרָק‎.\" R.

Of all the measurements established by the sages, when treating of vineyards, this is the only instance in which they require \"something more,\" beyond the fixed measure. The expression ‏פסקי עריס‎, \"part of an espalier of vines,\" is used when the middle of such an espalier has been destroyed, but five vines still remain on either side; if the open space between the two sides is only eight amoth, it may not be sown in; but if it is eight amoth and something more, the necessary room must be left for the due cultivation of the vine, and the remainder [of the open space] may be sown in.",
            "When an espalier of vines, proceeding from the corner of a wall, extends beyond it (vide Fig. 1), room must be left for the due cultivation of the vines, and the rest may be sown on. R. José saith, \"if this space doth not contain four amoth, it may not be sown on.\"",
            "It is lawful to sow under such reeds [extending beyond the vine-espalier] as a person does not wish to cut away; but if these reeds have been thus placed with the intention to train the young shoots of the vine on them, it is not lawful to sow under them.",
            "When branches of vines extend beyond the espalier, it is to be considered as if a plummet were pending from these branches, and all that space which comes within and under the perpendicular line of the plummet, it is unlawful to sow on. Such is likewise the case with the extending branches of a single vine. When vine-branches have been drawn from one tree to another [to connect them], it is prohibited to sow underneath them; but if they have been fastened by means of a rope [line] or [a band of] reeds, it is lawful to sow under the line; but if it [the rope] has been thus placed in order to train the young shoots of the vine thereon, it is not lawful to sow underneath."

            "When a vine is bent, and the tops of its branches set in the ground [to propagate], it is not lawful to sow therein, [even beyond the legal distance], unless the bent tops are covered with mould three hands high. [Such is also the law] should the vine have been drawn through a dry gourd or a tube; but if it be drawn over rock or stone it is lawful to sow thereon, although the soil with which it is covered be no higher than three finger breadths. If a vine has been bent in such a manner that the main stem is out of sight [under ground] the measure, [as to legal distance], must be calculated from the second stem; i.e. the place where it rises from the ground and again becomes visible.",
            "If three vines are bent, [and partly covered with mould], should their stems remain visible, R. Eleazar ben Zadock saith, \"If there remain between them not less than four, nor exceeding five amoth in width, they [the vines] must be looked upon as connected; otherwise, they are not so to be considered.\" It is likewise prohibited to sow near a withered vine: should this, however, have been done, it will not consecrate [the produce]. R. Meir saith, \"It is, in like manner, prohibited to set a cotton plant in a vineyard; nevertheless, if it has been done, it will not consecrate the produce [of the vineyard].\" R. Eleazar ben Zadock saith, in R. Meir's name, \"it is equally prohibited to set it [the cotton-plant] over a covered vine; but if this has been done it will not have the effect of consecrating [the vine].\"",
            "In the following places it is prohibited to sow, but if, nevertheless, this has been done, it will not consecrate the proceeds of the seed: these places are, the remainder of an incomplete plot of ground in the vineyard, [which does not contain the space required by law]; the remainder of an incomplete exterior space in the vineyard, [which is beyond the legal distance]; the remainder of an incomplete space between parts of an espalier of vines; and the remainder of an overhanging trellis; but whatsoever is sown under the branches of the vine, in the space legally required for its cultivation, or within the four amoth of the vineyard, becomes consecrated, [and the produce unlawful].",
            "If a man train his own vine over his neighbour's corn, it will thereby become consecrated, and he is bound to make good to his neighbour the damage he thus has caused him; but R. Joseph and R. Simeon say, \"No man can legally consecrate that which is not his own, [does not belong to him].\"",
            "R. José saith, \"It once happened that a man had sown his vineyard during the seventh [sabbatical] year. 1 The case came before R. Akivah, who said, 'No man can legally consecrate that which does not belong to him.'\"",
            "If a person has forcibly possessed himself of a vineyard, sown in it, and then left it, the rightful owner, on recovering possession, must have it cut down [immediately], even if on the middle days of the festival. To what extent is he [the owner] bound to go in respect to the hire of labourers, [in case they refuse to work during the middle days at the usual rate of wages]? To the extent of one-third [beyond the usual rate]. Should the labourers exact more, the owner is not bound to comply with their demand; but may have it cut in the usual way, after the festival. From what period is the vineyard called that of the forcible [wrongful] possessor? When the name of the right owner is forgotten.",
            "Vine branches which by a high wind have been cast among corn, [and have taken root], must immediately be cut down; but if, owing to accidental circumstances, the owner has not done so, the vine and the corn are allowed to be used. If corn or pot-herbs incline towards a vine, they must be put back, but, [if this is not done], it will not consecrate the produce. From what time does grain [planted near a vine] become consecrated? From the time it strikes root; and the grapes from the time they reach the size of a white bean. If grain is completely dry [if it be cut down] when a vine is planted near it, or if the grapes are fully ripe [when corn is sown], it does not cause either to be consecrated.",
            "When, near vines, any thing is sown in a pot with holes, it causes consecration; but, if sown in a pot without holes, it does not. R. Simeon saith, \"Both are, indeed, prohibited, yet if it has been done, it does not consecrate the produce of the vine.\" Should a pot, with any thing sown in it, be carried through a vineyard, [and some of the contents have dropped out, and taken root], it [the fruit of the vineyard] is prohibited as soon as the seed is grown a two-hundredth part."

It is prohibited to sow kilaim of seeds, and to allow it to grow; but it is lawful to eat of it, and, à fortiori, to derive benefit therefrom. Kilaim of clothing may lawfully be applied to any purpose, except that of dressing or clothing one's self therewith.

The priests, while ministering in the holy Temple, wear no other garments but such as are made of wool or of flax. Camel's wool, [or hair], which has been mixed with sheep's-wool, should the larger proportion be of the camel, it is lawful to add flax thereto; but should the larger portion be of the sheep, such addition is prohibited: if the proportions are equal, it is likewise prohibited.

Kilaim may not be worn even for an instant, nor may it be put on even over ten other garments, nor yet for the purpose of avoiding oppressive duties.",

R. José saith, \"that examination is not necessary with those which come from the sea-coast, or are brought from beyond seas,\" because the legal presumption is, that they have been made of hemp.

R. Simeon ben Eleazar saith, \"Whosoever wears kilaim deviates from the right path, and causes his heavenly Father also to deviate from him.\"",

If a needle [threaded either with linen or woollen thread] has been passed once only through a garment [without drawing it back through another place, thereby forming a stitch], it causes no connection, and is consequently not kilaim, and it is permitted to withdraw it on the Sabbath-day. But if the needle has been passed through twice, so that both ends of the thread are on the same side [of the stuff out of which the garment is made], that is a connection, and whoever withdraws it on the Sabbath-day is guilty.
