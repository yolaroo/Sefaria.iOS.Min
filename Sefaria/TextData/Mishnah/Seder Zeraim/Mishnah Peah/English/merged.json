These are things the fruits of which a man enjoys in this world, while the principal remains for him in the World to Come: Honoring father and mother, acts of kindness, and bringing peace between a man and his fellow. But the study of <i>Torah</i> is equal to them all.",
            "One should not make the <i>Peah</i> less than one-sixtieth [of the entire crop]. And although they [the Rabbis] say that there is no definite amount given for <i>Peah</i>, it is all based upon the size of the field and upon the number of poor [who will be collecting it] and upon the abundance of the crop.",
            "One may give <i>Peah</i> from the beginning of the field or from its middle. Rabbi Shimon says: only if one gives the full measure at the end. Rabbi Yehudah says: if one has left even one stalk [at the end], he adjoins to it [what he has left to the beginning or middle, and it becomes <i>Pe'ah</i>], if not, he has merely made it owner-less.",
            "They made a rule about <i>Peah</i>: all which is food and which is guarded and grows from the ground and collected in one crop and stored for preservation is obligated in <i>Peah</i>. And the grain and legumes are in this rule.",

And he may declare his produce ownerless and it is exempt from tithes until he smoothes out [the pile of produce]. And he may feed it to cattle and to a beast and to birds and it is exempt from tithes until he smoothes out [the pile of produce].  And he may take it from the granary and sow it and it is exempt from tithes until he smoothes out [the pile of produce], according to the words of Rabbi Akiva. If a priest and a Levite bought a granary, the tithes are theirs until it is smoothed out. One who dedicates [produce to the Temple] and redeems [produce from being dedicated to the Temple] is obligated in tithes until the treasurer smoothes out [the pile]."

One who harvests for the purpose of animal food creates a division, according to the words of Rabbi Meir. And the Sages say, \"He does not create a division unless he plowed.\"",

Rabbi Yehudah ben B’teirah says, “[The size that would be needed] in order to harvest and repeat.” And the law is according to his words.

And when for <i>Peret</i> [fallen grapes given to the poor] and <i>Olelot</i> [grapes that do not grow in clusters and are given to the poor]? From when the poor were able to go through the vineyard and come back. And when for olive trees? When the second rain has come. Rabbi Yehuda said, “And are there not those who do not harvest their olive trees until after the second rain? Rather, when the poor go out, and do not bring back four <i>Issarot</i> worth [specific unit of money].”",
            "[Poor] people are trusted with the <i>Leket</i> and the <i>Shikhecha</i>, and the <i>Pe'ah</i> [corner of the field that must be given to the poor] in their time, and with the poor-man's tithe all year long. And a Levite is trusted forever. And we do not trust except in matters that people are accustomed to.",
            "[Poor] people are trusted concerning wheat, but they are not trusted concerning flour and not concerning bread. [Poor] people are trusted concerning the barley of rice, but not trusted concerning it [the rice itself], regardless of whether it is raw or cooked. [Poor] people are trusted concerning beans, but not trusted concerning grits, regardless of whether they are raw or cooked. [Poor] people are trusted concerning oil, to say that it is poor-man's tithes, but not trusted to say that it is <i>Nikuf</i> [olives declared ownerless by the owner].",
            "[Poor] people are trusted concerning raw vegetables but not believed concerning cooked ones, unless he had a small thing, because it is common that the <i>Ba'al HaBayit</i> [property owner] takes it out from his stew pot.",
            "One must not reduce the poor’s portion of the granary below half a <i>Kav</i> [specific unit of volume] of wheat and a <i>Kav</i> of barley. R’ Meir says, \"Half a <i>Kav</i>\". A <i>Kav</i> and a half of kasha, and a Kav of dried figs or a <i>Maneh</i> [specific unit of volume] of figs. R’ Akiva says, \"A <i>Pras</i> [half a <i>Maneh</i>].” Half a <i>Log</i> [one fourth of a <i>Kav</i>] of wine. R’ Akiva says, “A fourth.” A fourth of a <i>Log</i> of oil. R’ Akiva says, “An eighth [of that].” And for the rest of the produce, Abba Shmuel said, “Enough that he can sell it and buy food for two meals.”",
            "This measure applies to priests and Levites and Israelites. If one wants to save some, he takes half and gives half. If he has a small amount, he gives it before them, and they divide it between themselves.",
            "One must not reduce the due of the poor that wander from place to place below a loaf that is the price of a  <i>Pundion</i>, when 4 <i>Se'ah</i> cost a <i>Sela</i>. If he spends the night, give him the support to spend the night. If he stays for Shabbat, give him food for 3 meals. Someone who has only 2 meals must not take from the soup kitchen. If he has food for 14 meals, he must not take from the money box. And the money box is brought around by two people and divided up by three people.",
            "Someone who has 200 <i>Zuz</i> does not take the <i>Leket</i>, <i>Shikhecha</i>, <i>Pe'ah</i>, and poor-man's tithes. If he has a <i>Dinar</i> less than 200, even if he is given 1000 at once, indeed he may take. If they are pledged to his creditor, or his wife’s marriage contract, indeed he may take. He is not obligated to sell his house or his clothes.",
            "Someone who has 50 <i>Zuz</i>, and he uses them for business, indeed he may not take. And all who don’t need to take, but take anyway, he will not disappear from the world until he will be made dependant on mankind. And all who need to take and don’t take, he will not die from old age until he will provide for others from his portion. And on this, the verse says, “Blessed is the man that relies on G-d, and G-d will be his security.” (Jeremiah 17:7) And so for a judge who judges in absolute truth. And he that is not lame, nor blind, nor limp, yet he makes himself up as one of these, he will not die of old age until he is like one of these, as it says, “Justice, justice shall you pursue.” (Deuteronomy 16:20) And every judge that takes a bribe and diverts the law, he will not die of old age until his eyes have dimmed, as it says, “And you shall not take a bribe, because a bribe blinds those that can see and understand, etc.” (Exodus 23:8)"
