            "Fifteen classes of women release themselves, their rivals, and the rivals of these, ad infinitum, from the obligation of Chalitzah and Yeboom; these are [when the widow of the deceased is], (1)the [illegitimate] daughter of the brother, or (2) her daughter, or (3) the daughter of his [illegitimate] son, or (4) his wife's daughter, or (5) her son's daughter, or (6) her daughter's daughter, or (7) his mother-in-law, or (8) the mother of his mother-in-law, or (9) the mother of his father-in-law, or (10) his uterine or maternal sister, or (11) his mother's sister, or (12) his wife's sister, or (13) the widow of his uterine or maternal brother, or (14) the widow of a brother who had not been contemporary with him, or (15) his daughter-in-law. All these release their rivals, and the rivals of these, ad infinitum, from the obligation of Chalitzah and Yeboom. If, however, any of these had died, or refused her consent, or had been divorced, or is unfit for procreation, their rivals may be married by Yeboom; yet, refusal of consent, or of unfitness [to procreate], cannot be applied in respect to his mother-in-law, or the mother of his father-in-law.",
            "How is this release of rivals [by the mentioned classes of women] to be understood? When a person's daughter, or one of the mentioned forbidden degrees [of intermarriage] was married to his brother, who at his decease [without issue] left another wife besides her, then, even as the daughter is released [as he may not marry her], thus also is her rival released. If such a rival of the daughter should marry the second [or other] brother, who at his decease left another wife besides her, then, even as the rival of his daughter is released [as he may not marry the former rival of his daughter], thus does the rival of that rival become also released, and thus in the same manner even if there should be a hundred [brothers]. How is it to be understood that when these have died, it is permitted to marry their rivals by Yeboom? If his daughter, or one of the mentioned degrees prohibited to intermarry, was married to his brother, who had another wife besides, and his daughter had died, or had been divorced before the decease of his brother [to whom she had been married], then is he permitted to marry her by Yeboom. If any of these relatives had been qualified to refuse her consent, and did not refuse, her rival must perform the ceremony of Chalitzah, but cannot be married to her brother-in-law by Yeboom.",
            "In the case of the [hereafter to be mentioned] six more rigidly prohibited degrees of relationship, in which the women may be married to others only [viz. to strangers and not to the brothers], it is permitted to him to marry their rivals, after the decease of their husband; viz. his mother's, his father's wife's, his father's sister's, of a sister of father's side, of the wife of his father's brother, and of the wife of his brother by father's side.",
            "Beth Shammai permit brothers to marry [by Yeboom] the rivals of women [who are in forbidden degrees of relationship to them]; but Beth Hillel prohibit it. If such had performed the ceremony of Chalitzah, they are disqualified according to Beth Shammai to marry a priest; but Beth Hillel declare them qualified. If the brother-in-law had married any of them [by Yeboom], Beth Shammai permit them, in case they had again become widows, to marry a Cohen; but Beth Hillel prohibit it: and although one school prohibits what the other permits, and one declares as an invalid marriage that which by the other is considered a valid one, yet the disciples of either school did not refrain from intermarrying with each other; and also in respect to those laws of clean and unclean things, in which they differ in opinion, they did not refuse to lend each other vessels to be used for purposes which both schools considered as clean and lawful to be used."

            "How is it to be understood that the widow of his brother, who had not lived contemporary with him [releases her rival]? When of two [married] brothers one dies [without issue] and another brother was born after the decease of the first mentioned, and the second [or surviving] brother marries by Yeboom his widowed sister-in-law, and dies, then that sister-in-law is released, having been the wife of a brother who had not been contemporary with the [third, or youngest] brother. The wife [widow] of the second brother is also free, as the rival of the first mentioned, but if the other brother had only promised marriage to her and died, then the sister-in-law must perform the ceremony of Chalitzah, but her brother-in-law may not marry her by Yeboom.",

If he had only promised her marriage and died, the second sister-in-law must perform the ceremony of Chalitzah, but the brother-in-law may not marry her; but R. Simeon says, \"[The third brother] may marry by Yeboom [in the two last cases], whichever he likes, or cause either to perform to him the ceremony of Chalitzah.\"",
            "A rule obtains in respect to marriage by Yeboom. Every woman whom it is unlawful to marry, by reason of being within the degrees of relationship forbidden to intermarry, may not perform the ceremony of Chalitzah, nor can be married by her brother-in-law by Yeboom, and all women who cannot be so married, owing to other legal prohibitions, or on account of holiness of station, must perform the ceremony of Chalitzah, but may not be married to the brother-in-law by Yeboom. When of two sisters [who had been married to two brothers] one only can be legally married [to a third, or surviving brother], she is bound either to give Chalitzah, or to marry that brother-in-law by Yeboom.",
            "By legal prohibitions [to marry as above mentioned] are meant the secondary degrees of relationship prohibited by the Rabbins to intermarry.—Prohibited to intermarry on account of holiness of station are, a widow to a high priest; a woman who had been divorced, or performed the ceremony of Chalitzah, who had [unlawfully] been married to an ordinary priest; a person born in adultery, and a daughter of the Nethinin married to an Israelite, or a daughter of Israel to a Nethin, or to one born in adultery.",
            "In every case where there is a surviving brother, though of illegitimate origin, the widow of the deceased brother of such a one becomes subject to the law of Yeboom; he also possesses all the rights of a brother, except when he is the son of a bondwoman, or of a strange [i.e. non-Israelite] woman. In every case where there is a son, that son releases his father's wife from the obligation of Yeboom, and even if illegitimate, is amenable to the penalties of the law against striking or cursing his father; he possesses, moreover, all the rights of a son, except he were the son of a bond-woman, or of a strange [i.e. non-Israelite] woman.",
            "When a person has given ‏קדושין‎ [i.e. betrothing] to one of two sisters, and does no longer know to which of them he gave it, he must give ‏גט‎, i.e. a letter of divorce to each. If he left at his decease one brother only, that brother must cause both [sisters] to perform Chalitzah to him. If he left two brothers, one must have Chalitzah performed to him, and the other may marry the sister-in-law by Yeboom, but if these brothers had already married the sisters, in anticipation, they are not to be separated from them.",
            "When two men [who are strangers to each other] have each of them betrothed one of two sisters, and neither of these men know which sister he has betrothed, then each man must give two Gets [letters of divorce] to the sisters. If [the men] died, and each left a brother, these brothers must have Chalitzah given to them by both sisters. If one of the men had one brother, and the other two, in the case of one brother only, he must have the Chalitzah performed by both sisters; and in that of the two brothers, one must have Chalitzah performed to him, and the other brother may marry his brother's widow by Yeboom, but if they had already married the sisters in anticipation, 5 they are not to be separated from them. If each man left two brothers, one brother of each pair must have Chalitzah performed to him by one of the sisters, and the other brother of each pair can then marry by Yeboom one of the sisters released by the Chalitzah performed to the other brother. If two brothers had already in anticipation received Chalitzah from the sisters, the latter are not to be separated from them.",
            "It is proper that the eldest brother should perform the duty of Yeboom; yet, if it were done by a younger brother, the marriage is valid. When suspected of carnal intercourse with a bond-woman, or with a non-Israelite woman, he may not marry her, even after [the first mentioned] had been manumitted, or [the last mentioned] had become a proselyte, but if he did marry [any of these women], they shall not be separated; but if a person should be suspected of having had adulterous intercourse with a married woman, who, in consequence, had been separated from her husband judicially, then, even if the said suspected person had already married her, they must be separated.",
            "A person who brings to a married woman a Get from her husband, from beyond sea, and declares that the said document was duly written and signed in his presence, may not marry that woman. If a person should say to a married woman, \"Thy husband is dead,\" or, \"I have murdered him,\" or, \"We have murdered him,\" such person may not marry that woman; R. Jehudah saith, \"If he says, 'I have murdered him,' the woman may not marry at all, but if he said, 'We have murdered him,' she may be married.\"",
            "A ‏חכם‎ [i.e. one learned in the Holy Law] who had declared binding a vow made by a woman against her husband, may not marry her; but he may do so in case that woman appeared before him at the tribunal, and there expressed her refusal, or performed the ceremony of Chalitzah; and in all the above-mentioned cases, if the men were married at the time [of the prohibition], and their wives died since, they may marry the women prohibited to them before; also, in case these women had, meanwhile, been married to others, and were divorced, or had become widows, the females also prohibited to these men, may marry their sons or brothers."

            "When, of four brothers, two married two sisters, and they who had married the sisters, died: the sisters must give Chalitzah, but may not be married to the brothers-in-law by Yeboom; and if they had prematurely married them, they must send them away. R. Eleazar saith, \"According to Beth Shammai such a marriage is valid; but according to Beth Hillel, they must be separated.\"",
            "If one of these sisters is prohibited to marry one of the brothers, owing to a prohibited degree of relationship between them, [although] he may not marry her, yet may he marry her sister, and both sisters are prohibited to the other brother. If one of these sisters is prohibited only on account of legal prohibition [by the Rabbins], or of holiness of station, she must perform Chalitzah, but he may not marry her by Yeboom.",
            "When one of the sisters is prohibited to marry one brother, and another sister the other brother, owing to prohibited degrees of relationship between them, then she who is prohibited to one brother, may marry the other; and this is the case to which allusion was made [above] where [it] is said, \"When, of two sisters, one only can be [lawfully] married by Yeboom, she must either perform the ceremony of Chalitzah, or be married by Yeboom.\"",
            "When, of three brothers, two were married to two sisters, or to a mother and a daughter, or to a grandmother and her grand-daughter, either her son's, or daughter's daughter, then these women must perform Chalitzah, but cannot be married by Yeboom. R. Simeon releases them from the obligation of Chalitzah. If any of these could not be married [to the third brother] on account of prohibited degree of relationship to him, he may not [indeed] marry her; but he may marry her sister. If one of the sisters is prohibited to him, only on account of legal prohibition [by the Rabbins], or on account of holiness of station, she must perform Chalitzah to him, but he may not marry her by Yeboom.",

To this case was the remark applied: \"Unhappy he, for [the loss of] his wife, and unhappy he, for [the loss of] his sister-in-law.\"",
            "When, of three brothers, two are married to two sisters, and one to a stranger: if one of them who married the sisters died, and the brother who had married the stranger marries the widow, and then also dies, the first widow is released, as sister of his wife and the second as her rival, but if he [i.e. the second deceased] had only promised marriage to the widow, the stranger must perform the ceremony of Chalitzah; but the brother-in-law may not marry her by Yeboom. When, of three brothers, two married two sisters, and the third a stranger: should the brother who married the stranger die, and one of those who had married the sisters, marries the widow, and also dies, the one widow is free, as being a wife's sister, and the other as her rival; but if he only promised marriage to the stranger, and then dies, she must perform Chalitzah, and may not be married to her brother-in-law by Yeboom.",

When, of three brothers, two were married to two sisters, and one to a stranger, if it should happen that one of those married to the sisters, divorced his wife; and that the brother married to the stranger died, and the widow was married to the brother who gave the divorce, and that this latter also died, then the following rule becomes applicable: namely, that in all cases where the husbands died, or when the woman had been divorced, their rivals are permitted to marry.",
            "In all [the mentioned fifteen classes where the Kedushin, or divorce, is doubtful, the ceremony of Chalitzah must be performed by their rivals; but these may not be married by Yeboom. What is meant by a doubtful kedushin [betrothment]? When the man threw the marriage-bond, and it is uncertain whether it fell nearest to him or to her, 10 then it is a doubtful betrothment. A doubtful divorce is,—when the husband did himself write the letter of divorce, without the signature of witnesses, or that it was signed by witnesses, but with the omission of date, or when it is properly dated, but attested by one witness only,—then is it a doubtful divorce.",
            "When three brothers have married three strangers [i.e. not related to each other], and one of the brothers died, and the second brother promises marriage to the widow, and dies: the woman must perform Chalitzah to the surviving brother, but he may not marry them by Yeboom, for it is said (Deut. xxv. 5), \"Her husband's brother shall go in unto her,\" &amp;c., i.e. her who reverts to him by the death of one of his brothers, but not her who reverts to him by the death of two brothers. R. Simeon saith, \"He may marry either, and must have the ceremony of Chalitzah performed to him by the other.\" When, of two brothers married to two sisters, one dies, and afterwards the wife of the surviving brother also dies, then he may never marry his brother's widow; because, there was a time when she was prohibited to him, [namely, during the life of his wife, her sister.]",

            "When a person had married his sister-in-law [by Yeboom], and she proved to have then been pregnant, the marriage must be dissolved, if she be delivered of a child at the full period of gestation, and both must bring a sin-offering; but if the child is prematurely born, the marriage need not be dissolved; if it be doubtful whether the child was born from the first husband in the ninth month, or from the second, in the seventh month, the marriage must be dissolved, but the child is legitimate, and both must bring the doubtful trespass-offering.",
            "In the case of property accruing to a woman, whilst waiting to be married by Yeboom, the schools of Shammai and Hillel agree, that she is entitled to sell it or give it away. How are they to act in case of the death of such a woman, with the amount of her dowry to which she is entitled by her Ketubah, and the private property she brings in with her [on her marriage], and takes back again [in case of divorce]? Beth Shammai decide, that it must be divided between her husband's, and her father's heirs. But Beth Hillel teach, that her private property remains in its existing power, her marriage portion in that of the heirs of her husband, and the property she brings and takes back with her, in that of her father's heirs.",
            "As soon as a brother-in-law has married a woman by Yeboom [and consummated the marriage], she must be considered as his wife in every respect, except that the portion allowed her in her marriage contract is to be charged on her late husband's property.",
            "The duty of Yeboom is obligatory in the first place on the eldest brother; should he refuse, all the other brothers must be applied to; if they also refuse, they must apply again to the eldest, and say unto him, \"The obligation is incumbent on you, [therefore] either receive Chalitzah from your sister-in-law, or marry her by Yeboom.\"",

            "A person who received Chalitzah from his sister-in-law, remains in respect to the inheritance [of his deceased brother's property] upon an equal footing with his other brothers; but if their father is yet alive, he inherits it; but he that married his sister-in-law by Yeboom acquires thereby all his brother's property. R. Jehudah saith, \"In either case, should the father still be alive, the property devolves on him.\" When a person has received Chalitzah from his sister-in-law, he may not marry her relations, nor she his. He may not marry her mother, nor her grandmother [whether her mother's or her father's mother], her daughter, or grand-daughter, whether of son or of daughter, or her sister, whilst she is alive. His brothers may marry her, but she may not marry his father, nor his grandfather, whether his father's or mother's father, his son, his son's son, his brother, or his brother's son. It is lawful, however, to marry the relations of the rival of the woman from whom a person has received Chalitzah, but not the rivals of the relation of the woman from whom he received Chalitzah.",

            "In case the sister of a woman in expectation of being married by Yeboom to her brother-in-law, should meanwhile have been betrothed to another brother, it is taught in the name of R. Jehudah ben Beterah that they shall admonish him to delay his marriage until the elder brother proceeds to an act [i.e. that of Yeboom or of Chalitzah]. As soon as he [the elder brother] has received Chalitzah from, or married his sister-in-law by Yeboom, the other brother may marry his betrothed also, in case the widow should have died; but if the brother-in-law died, he must divorce his betrothed and receive Chalitzah from his sister-in-law.",
            "Women who have become subject to Yeboom, may not proceed to it or to the ceremony of Chalitzah until after three months have elapsed [since the death of their husbands], other women also shall not be betrothed nor married [again] till after three months, whether they were virgins or not, whether divorced or widowed, married or only betrothed. R. Jehudah says, \"Women who had already been married may be betrothed immediately, and the betrothed ones married, except the betrothed in Judah, for there the intercourse of the bridegroom with his betrothed is less restrained.\" R. José says, \"All women may be immediately betrothed, except a widow, on account of the mourning [she is bound to observe for her deceased husband].\"",

If a person left two wives at his decease, the marriage by Yeboom or Chalitzah by one, releases her rival. If one is qualified to be married to a priest, and the other is not; if the brother-in-law receives Chalitzah, he must receive it of her who may not be married to a priest; but if he prefers to marry by Yeboom, he can take her who is qualified [to be married to a priest].",

Akivah; but the sages say they are not bastards: they agree, however, that the child of one who had married a relation of the woman from whom he received Chalitzah is a bastard.",
            "What's the definition of a mamzer?  [The offspring of a union with] someone who shares the same flesh who the Torah forbids to you, according to Rabbi Akiva.  Shimon the Yemenite says, a mamzer is  [the offspring resulting from] any [sexual] prohibition that carries the penalty of excision by the Hand of Heaven [\"kareit\"].  The halacha is according to Shimon the Yemenite.  Rabbi Joshua says, any [offspring resulting from a union] where there is a penalty of death by the court.  Rabbi Simon the son of Azai said, \"I found that it was written in the scroll where the courts would record the lineages of the families of Jerusalem that someone is a mamzer if he is the offspring of a married woman [and a man other than her husband], supporting the words of Rabbi Joshua.  \n\nIf a man's wife died, he is permitted to marry her sister.  If they divorced, and then the wife died, he is permitted to marry her sister.  If [they divorced and] the wife married another, and then the former wife died, he is permitted to marry his former wife's sister.

If he has betrothed a widow and [afterwards] is elected High Priest, he must not consume the marriage. But it happened that Yoshua, the son of Gamla, betrothed Marta, the daughter of Baytos, and the king elected him High Priest, and he consumed the marriage with her. If a woman who has to perform levirate falls upon a Priest and he is elected High Priest, even if he has made a promis of marriage to her, he must not consume the marriage with her.

If he married a woman, and stayed with her ten years, and she did not bear children - he may not abstain.  If he divorced her - she is permitted to marry another.  And the second may stay with her ten years.  And if she miscarried, he counts from the time that she miscarried.  Man is commanded to be \"fruitful and multiply,\" but not woman.

The term \"usufructum slaves,\" denotes, that the loss of these slaves by death, or the profit that may accrue from them by their increase, are entirely at the risk, or for the advantage of the wife; and, therefore, although the husband is bound to maintain them, yet they may not eat of his heave-offering. Slaves which are as an \"iron flock,\" are such, whose death is the husband's loss, or their increase his profit; and as he has thus the entire risk of them, they may eat of the heave-offering [as if they had been bought by him].",

Such is the dictum of R. Josh; but the sages argued against this, and said unto him, \"[If so] even as you affirm this in respect to an Israelite woman married to a priest, thus also, even if she were a priest's daughter married to a priest, and had been left pregnant by him at his decease, ought also not to be allowed to eat of the heave, on account of the share of the unborn infant?\" [Because the slaves are the property of the unborn infant as being the heir; and, according to R.

If an Israelite had relations with the daughter of a kohen, she may still continue to eat terumah. Iif she gets pregnant, she may no longer eat terumah. If the fetus was aborted in her womb, she may eat. But if she gave birth to a child, she may eat. The power of the son is thus greater than the father's power. A slave deprives a woman, due to his cohabitation, from eating terumah, but not as her offspring. How so? If the daughter of an Israelite was wed to a kohen, or if the daughter of a kohen was married to an Israelite, and she had a son by him, and that son went and violated a bondswoman who had a son by him, such a son is a slave.

He also shall not receive a share of the priestly oblation at the threshing-floor; he may sell his own heave, and keep the money for himself. He has no share in the consecrated things of the Temple, nor shall consecrated things be given to him; yet, those belonging to himself cannot be claimed, or exacted from him [by the priests]. He is also free from the payment of the two cheeks, the shoulder, and maw of his own sacrifice [to the priests]; and his firstborn cattle must be left to pasture till it contracts a legal blemish, and the most stringent regulations [regarding sacrifices] of priests and Israelites, are to be applied in respect to his sacrifices. If both [the husbands of his mother] were priests, he is bound [in case of death] to mourn for them, and they for him; he may not defile himself with their dead bodies, nor may they defile themselves with his; he is no heir to them, but they inherit his property.

Eleazar; but valid according to R. Akivah. R. Eleazar thus expounds the text (Deut. xxv. 9), \"Thus shall it be done,\" &amp;c. viz. \"All acts there prescribed must be performed, and the omission of any renders the Chalitzah void.\" But R.

Beth Shammai will only allow [the refusal] when it was made in the presence of the husband; but Beth Hillel permit it in his absence, as well as in his presence. Beth Shammai require the refusal to be made [formally] before a Beth Din [tribunal]; but Beth Hillel consider a refusal not made before a tribunal sufficient. Beth Hillel said to Beth Shammai, \"A girl may thus, during her minority, refuse four or five men.\" But the school of Shammai replied, \"The daughters of Israel are not to be thus loosely dealt with, therefore, as soon as such a girl expressed her refusal, she must wait [to be again betrothed] till she has attained her majority, or expressed her refusal of the man to whom she is betrothed, and marries another immediately.",

If he divorced her, and then desired to take her back, when she formally refused him, and married another from whom she was subsequently separated, or became a widow, the first husband may take her back; but if she had expressed her refusal, and the man took her again and then divorced her, upon which she was married to another, and became a widow, or was divorced, then the first husband may not take her back; the rule is when a Get was given after a declaration of refusal, he may not take her back, but he may do so if the refusal was posterior to the Get in point of time.",

Jehudah says, \"Even when he heard children say to each other, 'We are going [home] from the burial and lamentation for A.B.'\" It is immaterial whether the witness intended by that declaration to proffer it as testimony, or whether he did it without such intention. R. Jehudah ben Baba says, \"An Israelite may tender his evidence even intentionally, but the evidence of a heathen is void when it is proved that he has some private purpose, or intention to serve [by his evidence.]\"",
            "Evidence [of the death of a married man] is admissible even when the witness saw him only by candle or moonlight. A woman maybe permitted to re-marry, even if a voice in the air or echo had only been heard, declaring that event. It once happened, that a man, on the top of a mountain, called out, \"A.B., son of C.D., of the place E. is dead.\" They ascended the mountain without finding the person from whom the voice had proceeded, yet the wife [of A.B.] was permitted to marry again. Another case occurred in Tsal-mon,—a man exclaimed, \"N. N., son of N. N., of the place N., has been bitten by a venomous serpent, and must die.\" When they came to the wounded man, [his features] could no longer be recognized, yet his wife was permitted to marry again.",
            "R. Akivah says, \"When I went down to Neardeah to intercalate a month in the year, I met Nehemiah of Beth-delee, who told me, 'I heard that with the exception of R. Jehudah ben Baba, permission is refused in the Holy Land to a woman to re-marry upon the evidence of a single witness.' On my answering in the affirmative, he said, 'Tell them in my name you are aware that the tranquillity of this country is disturbed by armed hosts, [and therefore I cannot go to tender my personal evidence], but I have it in tradition from the elder Rabbon Gamaliel, that a woman may re-marry on the evidence of a single witness, or of that of a woman or slave.' When I returned and informed [the younger] Rabbon Gamaliel of this, he rejoiced and said, 'We have found a colleague for R. Jehudah ben Baba, [who agrees with him in this].' That circumstance reminded Rabbon Gamaliel [the younger], that once, when several men were killed at Tel Arzah, Rabbon Gamaliel, the elder, permitted their wives to re-marry on the evidence of a single witness, and to receive as valid evidence the testimony of a witness, whose knowledge of the fact is only derived from the deposition he heard another witness make in this case, also, [to grant this permission to re-marry] on the evidence of a slave-woman, or female slave.\" R. Eleazar and R. Joshua are, however, of opinion, that the mentioned permission ought not to be granted to a woman to re-marry upon the evidence of a single witness. R. Akivah saith, \"Neither upon that of a woman, a slave, a bond-woman, or of near relatives.\" But the sages said unto him, \"It happened once, that when a family of Levites went to Zoar, the city of Palms, one [of the said Levites] fell ill on the road, and they brought him to an inn. When they returned, they asked the hostess, 'Where is our companion?'—She answered, 'He died, and I have had him buried': permission was thereupon granted the wife of the deceased to re-marry.\" They [the sages] said [moreover] to him, \"Shall not the evidence of a woman of sacerdotal race be equally admissible as that of the [heathen] hostess of an inn?\" but he replied, \"The reason why credence was accorded to this hostess was, because she produced to them the staff of the deceased, his travelling-bag, and the roll of the law he carried with him.\""
