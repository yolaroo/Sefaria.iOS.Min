Through money: The House of Shamai say: with a dinar or with the equivalent value of a dinar; and the House of Hillel say: with a peruta or with the equivalent value of a peruta. How much is a peruta? One eighth of the Italian issar.  She acquires herself through a get or through the death of the husband.  A levirate wife is acquired through sexual intercourse, and acquires herself through the shoe-removal ceremony or through the death of the levirate husband.",

[A slave] who is pierced is acquired through piercing, and acquires himself through a Jubilee [year] or through the death of the master.",

Anyone who deals with women should not be alone with women. And one should not teach his son a profession [that would cause him to be] among women. R. Meir says, a person should always teach his son a clean (and easy) profession, and he should pray to the One who makes people wealthy and who owns all things, for there is no profession which does not have poverty and wealth. For poverty is not due to one's profession, and wealth is not due to one's profession, but it is all according to one's merit. R. Shimon b. Elazar says, have you seen in all your days a beast or fowl that has a profession? [Yet] they sustain themselves without trouble. And they were created solely to serve me, and I was created solely to serve my Master! So all the more so, I should be able to sustain myself without trouble! However, I did bad with my actions, and I deprived myself of my sustenance. Abba Garin Ish Tzadin says in the name of Abba Geria, a person should not teach his son to be a donkey-driver, a camel-driver, a barber, a sailor, a shepherd, or a shopkeeper, for their professions are the professions of thieves. R. Yehuda says in his name, most donkey-drivers are wicked, and most camel-drivers are honorable. Most sailors are pious. The best physicians [are destined] for hell, and the most honorable butchers are partners with Amalek. R. Nehorai says, I leave all professions in the world and I do not teach my son anything other than Torah, for a person enjoys its reward in this world and the profit continues into the world to come. And this is not the case for the rest of the professions. When a person encounters sickness, or old age, or suffering and is not able to engage in his profession, he will surely die of hunger. But the Torah is not like this, but rather it protects him from all badness in his youth and grants him hope in his old age. Regarding his youth, it says \"Those who wait for the Lord will have their strength renewed\" (Isaiah 40:31). Regarding his old age it says \"They shall still bear fruit in old age\" (Psalms 92:15). And so it says regarding Abraham our father, peace be upon him, \"And Abraham was old...and the Lord blessed Abraham with everything\" (Genesis 24:1). We find that Abraham our father performed the entire Torah [even] before it was given, as it says \"Because Abraham listened to My voice, and he observed My statutes, commandments, laws, and teachings\" (Genesis 26:5)."
