            "One who prepares breads in order to separate them (for the priest's tithe), and bites them--the House of Shammai says: he has exacted usury concerning the priestly food of the day; the House of Hillel says: he has not exacted usury.  If two pieces of dough stick together, or if two loves stick together, or if one bakes one batter-cake on top of another before the loaf crusted slightly in the oven, or froth, or the boiling of beans, or the boiling of \"new\" wine (of the produce lawfully not yet fit for use), and Rabbi Judah says: even that of using \"new\" cedar wood--the House of Shammai says: he has exacted usury concerning the priestly food of the day; the House of Hillel says: he has not exacted usury. But they (the Houses of Hillel and Shammai) agree (stringently) in the remainder of the questions of the impurities, whether light or severe.",

            "A knob that is behind a loaf, a small salt morsel, or a burnt crust less than a finger's breadth, Rabbi Yose says: Whatever is eaten with it is rendered impure by a Tevul Yom, and needless to say [the same applies] to any other impurity.",
            "A pebble in a loaf, a big salt morsel, or a lupine, or a burnt crust more than a finger's breadth, Rabbi Yose says: Whatever is not eaten with it is ritually pure of an Av Hatum'ah, and needless to say of a Tevul Yom.",

So says Rabbi Meir. The Sages say: They are pure of a Tevul Yom but impure of any other impurity. Barley and spelt which are peeled, and wheat regardless of whether it is peeled or not, Black cumin, Sesame or Pepper -- Rabbi Yehuda says: Also White Beans -- are ritually impure of a Tevul Yom, and needless to say of any other impurities."

Except for liquid that is a \"father of impurity.\"  ",

            "Porridge made of terumah and the garlic or oil [it contained] was of non-sacred stuff, and one who immersed that day (a tevul yom) touched part of them, he has disqualified the whole thing;   \nBut if the porridge was of non-sacred stuff and the garlic or oil it contained was of terumah, and a tevul yom touched part of them, he disqualifies only the part he has touched.   \nIf the greater part was garlic then they go after the majority.   \nRabbi Judah said: When is this so? When it formed one cohesive mass in the pot, but if it was scattered in the mortar, then it is pure, since he wishes that it should be scattered.   \n[Similarly] with all other mashed foods which were mashed with liquids. \nBut those which are usually mashed with liquids and yet were mashed without liquids, though they formed one lump in the pot, they are regarded as a cake of preserved figs.\n",
