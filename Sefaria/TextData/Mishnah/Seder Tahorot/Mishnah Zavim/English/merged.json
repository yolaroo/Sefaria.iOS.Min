            "One who sees one emission, Beit Shammai say, he is like a [woman] watching from day to day for another emission, but Beit Hillel say he is like someone who had a seminal emission.  If he saw [an emission] on the first day, nothing on the second day and then on the third day saw two separate emissions or one emission that had a volume of two, Beit Shammai say he is a full fledged Zav but Beit Hillel say, he makes anything he sits on impure and requires immersion in living water, i.e. a mikvah, [to become pure] but he does not have to bring a sacrifice.  Rabbi Eliezer son of Yehuda says, Beit Shammai agree in this case that he is not a full fledged Zav, rather they argue in the case where on the first day he sees two emissions or one which has the volume of two, nothing on the second day and then sees one emission on the third day.  In this case, Beit Shammai say he is a full fledged Zav but Beit Hillel say, he makes anything he sits on impure and requires immersion in living water, i.e. a mikvah, [to become pure] but he does not have to bring a sacrifice. ",
            "One who sees a seminal emission on the third day of his Zav counting [of 7 days without an emission] Beit Shammai say, it destroys the two days beforehand, i.e. he must start his 7 day count again, but Beit Hillel say it only disregards that day [and he can continue his count starting with the next day]  Rabbi Yishmael says if he sees [a seminal emission] on the second day, it disregards his previously counted days.  Rabbi Akiva says, If one sees [a seminal emission] on either the second or third day [of his count] Beit Shammai say it disregards the two days beforehand, but Beit Hillel say it only disregards that day.  They agree, however, that if he sees a seminal emission on the 7th day it only disregards that day.  However if he sees a Zav emission even on the 7th day it disregards all previous days [and he must restart his count].",
            "If he saw one emission today and two tomorrow, or two today and one tomorrow, or three on three days or three nights he is a full fledged Zav. ",
            "If he saw one emission and then waited [without seeing an emission] for long enough to immerse and dry off and then saw two more emissions, or one emission with the volume of two or he saw two emissions or one with the volume of two then waited [without seeing an emission] for long enough to immerse and dry off and then saw one emission, he is a full fledged Zav. ",
            "If he saw one [emission] like [the volume of] three [emissions], which [takes place of the time it would to take to walk] from Gad Yon to Shiloch, which is [also the time] in order to immerse twice and dry twice, he is a full fledged Zav. If he saw one [emission] like [the volume of] two, he makes [vessels] impure by sitting or lying [on them] and needs to go into 'live water' (i.e. immerse in a Mikva) but he is exempt from bringing a sacrifice [like a full fledged Zav]. Rabbi Yose said: They didn't talk about [the case of] 'one [emission] like [the volume of]...' unless it was [like the volume of] three.",
            ".[If] one saw  one [emission] during the day and one at twilight, [or] one at twilight and one the next day, if it is known that part of the sighting [of the emission] was today and part was the next day, [the law] is clear  regarding his sacrifice [he doesn't need to bring it] and his impurity [he is impure]. If is was doubtful if part of the sighting was today and part was the next day, it is certain about his impurity, but it is doubtful regarding his sacrifice. If he saw [emissions] on two [consecutive] twilights, is doubtful regarding his impurity and his sacrifice. If he saw one [emission] at twilight, it is doubtful regarding his impurity."

            "All are made impure by an emission, even converts, even slaves, whether they are freed are whether they are not freed, a deafmute, a mentally handicapped person, a child, a eunuch because of a man [made injury], and a eunuch from birth (lit. sun eunuch). A Tumtum [person of uncertain gender], or a transvestite, we place upon them the stringencies of [both] a man and a woman; they can make [vessels] impure through [menstruation] blood, like a woman and through semen, like a man, but their impurity is only out of doubt.",
            "Through [these] seven ways we determine if one is a Zav, unless it is [already] known to be a Zav emission: food [which causes emission], drink [which causes emission], lifting [heavy objects], jumping, sickness, [improper] sight and thoughts (if he did any of the above, his discharge is considered normal) [even if] he had [improper] thought without sight or sight without thought. Rabbi Yehuda says: Even if he saw a domesticated animal, a wild animal, or a bird copulating with each other, [and] even if he saw the colored clothing of a woman [he would be pure from an accidental emission]. Rabbi Akiva says: even if ate any food, whether it was good or bad [for emission] or he drank any drink. The [sages] said to him: Now, [according to you] there are no Zavim! He responded to them, \"The responsibility of [creating] Zavim is not yours!\" [However] once it is known to be a Zav emission [after two such previous emissions], we no longer check him. Even his accidental [emissions] and seminal emissions are [considered] impure because 'the matter has feet' (i.e. there is already reason to believe it is a Zav emission). [If] he saw a first sighting [of an emission], we check him [for these seven things]. For the second one we [also] check him. For the third one, we don't check him. Rabbi Eliezer says: Even for the third one, we check him because [we need to know if he is obligated in] a sacrifice.",
            "One who sees a seminal emission, he cannot be made impure through a Zav emission for a twenty four hour period (lit. from time to time). Rabbi Yose says: [the exemption is only] for that day [until sunset]. A non-Jew who saw a seminal emission and [then, within a day] converted, immediately he can be made impure through a Zav emission. [A woman] who saw [menstrual] blood or was in labor, [retroactively makes impure things she touched] within the twenty four hours [before these events]. One who hits his slave [about which the Torah says, \"If one hits his servant...he will surely be punished unless he stay alive] a day or two days\", [this means] for a twenty four hour period [after he was hit]. A dog that eats the flesh of a corpse, for three twenty four hour periods [afterward], [the flesh] remains intact [and can make things impure if the dog died].",
            " A Zav makes things impure by laying down [on them] in five ways [and this impurity is of a level that it] makes people impure [so that they can make] clothing impure: by standing, by sitting, by laying down, [supporting] a hanging [object] and by leaning. [The things that] he lay on make [other things] impure in seven ways [and this impurity is of a level that it] makes people impure [so that they can make] clothing impure: by standing [on them], sitting [on them], laying down [on them], supporting [them], leaning [on them], touching [them] and lifting [them]."

            "[If] a Zav and a pure person are sitting on a boat or on a raft or they are riding on an animal, even if their clothing is not touching, they get Tamei Midras (become sources of impurity because they are supporting the Zav). [If] they were sitting on a plank or a bench or a frame of a bed or a beam when the [above] are insecure, [or] they went up into a tree that is weak, or in a branch that is weak in a tree that is strong, [or they were both on] an Egyptian ladder that wasn't fixed [to a wall] with a nail, [or] on a ramp or a rafter or on a door when mud wasn't used [to secure them in the ground], they become impure. Rabbi Yehuda would call them pure. ",
            "[Included in the list above is when they] close or open [a door together] but the sages say: [they only become Midras Tamei] when one is closing and one is opening. [Also included is when] one is raising the other from a pit. Rabbi Yehuda says: Only when the pure one is lifting the impure one (i.e. the Zav). [Also included is when] they twist [threads] into ropes but the sages say: Only when the one is pulling this way and the other is pulling that way (the opposite direction). [Also included is when] they are weaving [together], whether they are standing or sitting, or they are grinding [grain]. Rabbi Shimon would call pure all of these [cases of weaving and grinding] except when they are grinding with a hand mill. [If they are] unloading a donkey or loading it, when the load is heavy, they are impure. When the load is light, they are pure. But both of these [cases], [they are] pure [if they are] shul goers (referring to non-Kohens who can't eat Teruma anyway) but [,if they are Kohanim,]are impure to [eat] Teruma (the gift given to the Kohen).",
            "[If] a Zav and a pure person sit on a big boat - [but] what is a 'big boat'? Rabbi Yehuda says: Any that a man is not able to shake it - [or if] they were sitting on a plank or a bench or a frame of a bed or a beam when the [above] are not insecure, [or] they went up into a tree that is strong, or in a branch that is strong [or they were both on] a Tyrian ladder or an Egyptian [ladder] that was fixed [to a wall] with a nail, [or] on a ramp or a rafter or on a door when mud was used [to secure them in the ground], even [only] on one side, they are [still] pure. A pure person that hit an impure person is pure. [But if] an impure person hit a pure person, [the pure person] is impure because if the pure person would pull [himself away, as he was hitting him], the impure person would surely fall.  "

            "Rabbi Yehoshua says: [If] a Nidda (a woman impure through menstruation) sits with a pure woman on a bed, [even] the [pure woman's] head covering is Tamei Midras (become sources of impurity because they are supporting the Zav). [If] she sat in a boat, [even] the utensils that are at the top of the mast of the boat are Tamei Midras. [If] she took a trough filled with clothing, when its weight is heavy, they are impure. When its weight is light, they are pure. [If] a Zav pounds [down on] a balcony, and [then] a loaf of Teruma (gift given to Kohen) falls, it is [still] pure.",
            "[If a Zav] pounded [down] on a rafter, on a rafter frame, on a pipe, on a board even if it was [only] secured with rope, on an oven, on a flour receiver [of a mill], on the frame of a mill, on a handle of a hand mill, on the Se'ah (Mishnaic volume) [-sized container] of a mill of olives - Rabbi Yose says: Even on a board of a bathhouse attendant [that he would sit on], [they are pure.",
            "[If a Zav] pounded [down] on a door, on a door-bolt, on a lock, on an oar, on a frame of a mill, on a tree which is weak, on a branch which is weak in a tree which is strong, on an Egyptian ladder that wasn't fixed [to a wall] with a nail, [or] on a ramp or a rafter or on a door when mud wasn't used [to secure them in the ground], they become impure. [If he pounded down] on a chest, on a box, on a cupboard (lit. tower), they become impure. Rabbi Nechemia and Rabbi Shimon would call these (the case of the chest, box or cupboard) pure. ",
            "[If] a Zav was lying on five benches or on five money-bags, lengthwise, they become impure. Width-wise, they are [still] pure. [If] he slept [on these and] it is doubtful if he turned over [while] on them, they become impure. If he was lying on six chairs [with] two of his on two of them, two of his feet on two of them, his head on one, [and] his body on one, the only one that is impure is the one beneath his body. [If] he was standing on two chairs, Rabbi Shimon says: If they are far from each other, they are [still] pure. ",
            "Ten garments, this on top of that one, [if a Zav] slept on the top one, they are all impure. [If] a Zav was in [one] cup of a balance scale and [piece of furniture used for] lying or sitting was opposite him [in the other cup], if it was leaning towards the Zav, they are [still] pure. If it was leaning towards them, they become impure. Rabbi Shimon says: with a single [piece of furniture] it becomes impure but with many, it is [still] pure because a single one does not support most of [the Zav].",
            "[If] a Zav was in [one] cup of a balance scale and food or liquid was in the second cup, it becomes impure. But [if instead of a Zav it was] a corpse, it is pure unless a person [was in the other cup]. This [following law] is more stringent by Zav than by a corpse but the [law after this] is more stringent by a corpse than by a Zav: A Zav makes a [piece of furniture used for] lying and sitting under him impure [of a level that these can] make a person impure [who can then] make clothing impure and [makes things placed on top of him] a Madaf (term used for things placed on top of a Zav) which can then make food and drinks impure, which a corpse can't make impure [in these ways]. A more stringent [law] by a corpse [is] that a corpse makes [items] impure [when they are] in [the same] tent [as it] and makes [people] impure for seven [days] which a Zav can't make impure [in these ways].",
            "[If a Zav] was sitting on a bed and four garments were under the four legs of the bed, [then they] become impure because [the bed] cannot stand on three [legs]. Rabbi Shimon calls them pure. [If a Zav] was riding on an animal there were four garments under the four legs of the animal, they are [still] pure because [the animal] can stand on [only] three [legs]. [If] there was one garment under its two front legs or under two of its back legs, or under a front and back leg, it becomes impure. Rabbi Yose says: A horse transmits impurity with [only] its back legs but a donkey [does this] with [only] its front legs because a horse leans on its back legs, but a donkey leans on its front legs. [If a Zav] sat on the beam of an olive press (used to further crush the olives), utensils in the olive basket (where the beam has been placed) become impure but [if he sat] on the launderer's clothes press, utensils beneath them(i.e. in between the two boards that press the clothes) are [still] pure. Rabbi Nechemia call them impure."

            "One who touches a Zav, or a Zav touches him, one moves (without touching) a Zav , or if a Zav moves him, [attains a level of impurity that] can make impure food or drink or utensils that can be immersed [in a Mikva and thereby made pure] through contact, but not through lifting [them indirectly]. [The following is] a rule that Rabbi Yehosua said:  Anyone who is [of a level of impurity to] make his clothing impure, when he is touching [the impure source], he can make food and drink the first [level of impurity] , and hands the second [level], but cannot make impure people or clay vessels. After he has separated from the impure source, he makes drinks the first [level of impurity] and food and hands to be the second [level of impurity] and cannot make clothing impure.",
            "And another rule that they [the sages] said: Anything being supported on top of a Zav becomes impure but anything that is supporting the Zav is [still] pure except for [furniture] that is viable for laying or sitting, or [another exception is] a person. How [does this law apply]? [If] the finger of a Zav was under a row of brick, the pure person [sitting] on top of [the bricks] or a pure person under them, he makes them both Metamei Shnaim U'Posel Echad (lit. makes two impure and one disqualified, a term referring to a level of impurity that can make something impure which can then make something else impure which can then disqualify Teruma, i.e. an Av HaTuma/source of impurity). If [either of them] separated themselves [from the bricks] he is Metamei Echad U'Posel Echad (lit. makes one impure and one disqualified, i.e. first level of impurity that can make something impure which can then disqualify Teruma). [If] food or drink or [furniture used for] lying or sitting, or Madaf (term used for other utensils placed on top of a Zav) placed on top [of a Zav] Metamei Shnaim U'Posel Echad. [If] they were separated, they Metamei Echad U'Posel Echad. But [furniture used for] lying or sitting below [a Zav] Metamei Shanim U'Posel Echad. Food, drink and Madaf below become impure.",
            "[The reason for the previous law] is because anything supporting or being supported by [furniture used for] lying is [still] pure except for a person. Anyone supporting or being supported by a corpse of an animal is [still] pure unless he moves it. Rabbi Eliezer says: Only (lit. even) if he supports it [while moving it]. Anyone supporting or being supported by a corpse is [still] pure unless it makes a roof [over the corpse], or [unless] it is a person when he is moving it. ",
            "[If] part of an impure person is on a pure person or part of a pure person is on an impure person, [or] the connections of an impure person (referring to their teeth, nails and hair) are on a pure person, or the connections of a pure person are on an impure person, they become impure. Rabbi Shimon says: [If] part of an impure person is on a pure person, he becomes impure but if part of a pure person is on an impure person, he is [still] pure.",
            "[If] an impure person was on part of [furniture used for] lying on, or a pure person was on part of [impure furniture used for] lying on, [the pure object] becomes impure. [If] part of an impure person was on [furniture used for] lying on, it is [still] pure. It ends up being that [impurity both] enters [the furniture] and emits from it, with part of it [being lain on]. So too, a loaf of Teruma (gift given to the Kohen) that is put on [impure furniture used for] lying on and there is paper between them, whether [the loaf] is on top or it is on the bottom [of the furniture], it is [still] pure. So too, [if instead of paper] there was an Even Minga'as (stone which was part of a house which contracted Tzara'as) it is [still] pure. Rabbi Shimon calls this [last case] impure.",
            "One who touches a Zav or a Zava (when a woman sees blood beyond her period) or a Niddah (a menstruating woman) or a woman who has recently given birth, or a Metzora (person who contracted Tzara'as), [whether through furniture used for] lying or sitting, they are Metamei Shnaim U'Posel Echad (see Mishna 2). [When] they separate [from the source of impurity] they are Metamei Echad U'Posel Echad. [The law] is the same whether one touched, moved, supported or was being supported [by any of the above sources of impurity].",
            ".One who touches the Zav emission of a Zav or his spit, semen, urine, or the blood of a Niddah, is Metamei Shnaim U'Posel Echad (see Mishna 2). [If] he separated, he is Metamei Echad U'Posel Echad. [The law] is the same whether one touched or moved any of the above sources of impurity]. Rabbi Eliezer says: Even (alternatively, only) if he supported [them]. ",
            "One who supports an [impure] saddle or is supported by it or [one who] moves it, is Metamei Shnaim U'Posel Echad (see Mishna 2). [When] he separates [from it], [he is] Metamei Shnaim U'Posel Echad. One who supports an animal corpse or water that purifies (this water also impurifies the one who carries it) [because ashes of a red cow are mixed in] of an amount that can be sprinkled, is Metamei Shnaim U'Posel Echad.

[If] he stuck his head into an oven (lit. air of an oven) [with it still in his throat], it is [still] pure and the oven is [still] pure (this line is seemingly superfluous because both phrases refer to the oven). [If] he spit out or swallowed it, he is Metamei Echad U'Posel Echad but when it is [still] in his mouth before he swallows it, he is pure.",
            "One who touches a Sheretz (one of eight animals whose carcasses are sources of impurity), or semen or something made impure by a corpse or a Metzora during his [initial] count [of seven days] or water that purifies (this water also impurifies the one who carries it) [because ashes of a red cow are mixed in] that is not enough to sprinkle, or an animal carcass or an [impure] saddle is Metamei Echad U'Posel Echad. This is the rule: Anyone who touches one of any of the sources of impurity [which are listed] in the Torah, is Metamei Echad U'Posel Echad unless [the source was] a person. [When] he separated [from it, whether it was a person or not] he is Metamei Echad U'Posel Echad. ",

And one who has sexual intercourse with a Niddah is like one who was made impure by a corpse except that one who has sexual intercourse with a Niddah is more stringent, because he makes [things] impure by lying and sitting [a level of impurity which is] lenient impurity (i.e. first level of impurity) [which can impurify] food and drinks.
