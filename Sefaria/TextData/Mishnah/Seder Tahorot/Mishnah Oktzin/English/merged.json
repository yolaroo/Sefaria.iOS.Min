If it does protect the fruit, even if it does not serve as a handle it is susceptible to impurity and can transfer impurity and it is counted as part of the minimal egg size.  If it neither protects nor serves as a handle it is not susceptible to impurity nor can it transfer impurity.",

Rabbi Yehudah says, \"The big roots of radishes, combine [for the minimal egg size], but its fibers, does not combine [for the minimal egg size].\"  Roots of mint,  rue, field vegetables, garden vegetables which are uprooted to replant, and the stalks of grain, and their husks  - Rabbi Elazar says even the cobweb-like waste covering - all of these ar susceptible to impurity and can transfer impurity and combine [for the minimal egg size].",
            "The following can become impure, and can make other things impure but do not combine.  The roots of garlic, onion and leek when they are dry and their stems at the place where there is no food against them, and the handle of a grape vine a fistful on either side, the handle of a cluster of grapes, in any amount and the tail of a cluster of grapes that became exposed [through the removal of grapes] and four fistfuls of the handle of the date palm, and the three fistfuls of an ear of grain and three fistfuls of all handles of things that are cut, and whatever is not usually cut, even a minute amount of their handles or roots, and the bristles of an ear of grain these things can become impure, and can make other things impure but do not combine.",
            "The following neither defile nor can they be defiled nor do they join together: \nThe roots of cabbage-stalks, \nYoung shoots of beet growing out of the root, and [the same with] turnips,\n[And produce whose roots] that are normally cut off but were pulled up [with their roots]. \nRabbi Yose declares them all susceptible to impurity, but he declares insusceptible to impurity cabbage-stalks and turnips. \n",
            "\"Handles\" of all foods that he threshed on the threshing-floor are clean.\nRabbi Yose declares them unclean. \nA sprig of a vine the he stripped is clean.\nIf he left one grape on it, it is unclean. \nA twig of a date that they stripped is clean.\nIf he left one date on it, it is unclean.\nThe same with beans: if they stripped the twigs it is clean. \nBut if he left one bean pod, it is unclean. \nRabbi Elazar ben Azariah declares [the stalk] of the broad bean clean, but declares unclean the stalk of other beans, since he desires its use. \n",
            "Stems of figs and dried figs, klusim, and carobs both defile and can be defiled and join together. \nRabbi Yose says: also the stem of a gourd.\nStems of pears and krutumelin pears, quinces, and crab-apples, the stem of the gourd if it is a handbreadth and the stem of the artichoke if it is one handbreadth. \nRabbi Elazar bar Zadok says: two handbreadths.\n[All] these defile and are defiled; but they do not join together. \nAnd all other stems neither defile nor are they defiled.\n"

            "Olives which he pickled together with their leaves [the leaves] are clean, for he pickled them only for the sake of appearance. \nThe fibrous stuff on a zucchini and its flower on it are clean.\nRabbi Judah says: as long as it is still before the merchant, it is unclean.\n",
            "All pits defile and are defiled but do not join together.\nThe pits of a fresh date, even when detached does join together.\nOf a dried date does not join together. \nTherefore, the stem of a dried date does join together, but that of a fresh date does not join together. \nA pit part of which has been detached, the part opposite the edible portion joins together. \nA bone on which there is flesh, the part that is opposite to the edible part joins together. \nIf it had flesh only on one of its sides: \nRabbi Ishmael says: we look at it as though [the flesh] goes around it like a ring; \nBut the sages say: the part opposite  the edible part joins together, as for example with savory, hyssop and thyme.\n",
            "A pomegranate or melon part of which has rotted, [the rotten part] does not join together.\nAnd if it is not rotted at this end and not rotted at that end, but has rotted in the middle, [the rotten part] does not join together. \nThe stem of a pomegranate does join together, but its flower does not join together.\nRabbi Elazar says: even the comb is clean. \n",
            "Allpeels defile and are defiled, and join together. \nRabbi Judah says: there are three peels for an onion: the inside one whether it is whole or whether it be pierced joins together; the middle one when it is whole joins together, but when it is pierced it does not join together; the outside one is in either case clean.   \n",
            "One who chops up [produce] for cooking, even if he did not finish it up, it is not regarded as connected. \nTo pickle or to boil it, or to put it on the table, then it is regarded as connected. \nIf he began to take [the pieces] apart, the [part] of the food which he began [to take apart] is not considered connected. \nNuts that he strung together, or onions that he piled together, are regarded as connected.\nIf he began to take the nuts apart, or to strip the onions, they are not connected. \n[Shells of] nuts and almonds are regarded as connected [with the nut] until he crushes them.\n",
            "[The shell of] a roasted egg [is regarded as connected] until he cracks it.\nThat of a hard-boiled egg until he breaks it up. \nA bone that has marrow in it is regarded as connected until he breaks it up.\nA pomegranate that he has divided is regarded as connected until he knocks it with a stick. \nSimilarly, loose stitches of launderers or a garment that had been stitched together with threads of kilayim, is regarded as connected until he begins to untie them.  \n",
            "The green leaves of vegetables join together. And the white ones do not join together. \nRabbi Elazar bar Zadok says: the white ones of cabbage join together because they are food. \nSo also of lettuces, because they preserve the food part.  \n",
            "Onion leaves or the offshoots of onions, if there is moisture in them they are measured as they are; if there is empty space within them, he must squeeze their empty space together. \nSpongy bread is measured as it is, but if there is empty space within it, he must squeeze its empty space together.. \nThe flesh of a calf which had swollen, or the flesh of an old [beast] that has shrunken, are measured as they are. \n",
            "A cucumber which he planted in a pot and it grew and it went out of the pot is clean. \nRabbi Shimon said: what is its nature to make it clean? Rather, that which has already become unclean remains unclean, and only that which is pure may be eaten.\n",
            "Vessels made of dung or of earth through which the roots can penetrate, do not render the seeds susceptible to impurity. \nA perforated pot does not render seeds susceptible; but if it has no hole, it does render the seeds susceptible. \nWhat is the measure of the hole? Such that a small root can go out. \nIf he filled it with earth to its brim, it is like as a frame that does not have an edge.\n"

But the sages say: [it all depends] whether [the figs] could still live.  Grain that had been uprooted, but is still attached to the soil even by the smallest of roots, is clean.   ",
