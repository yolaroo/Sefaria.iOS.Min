Impure liquids make foods impure (when poured on them) with or without intent.",

If to make liquids fall, Beit Shamai rules that \"if one pours\" applies to that which falls from the tree and that which remains on the tree. Beit Hillel rules in this case that \"if one pours\" applies to that which falls from the tree but not to that which remains on the tree, because his intent is that the objects fall out of their containers.",
            "If one shook a tree and it fell upon another tree, or shakes a sochah (branch) to detach its fruit, and under them were seeds or vegetables still connected to the ground and wet, the House of Shammai says: this comes under the law of \"Be Chi Yutan,\" \"if water be put.\" But the House of Hillel says, this fruit does not come under the law of Be Chi Yutan. Rabbi Yehoshua says in the name of Abba Yosi Hali Kafri, a man from  Tibbon, marvel at yuorself if there is anything in the Torah about a liquid causing susceptibility to tumah (impurity), except if one intentionally put it on, as it is written (Leviticus 11): \"If water is placed upon the seed.\"  ",

Beis Hillel say: The [law of] Be Chi Yutan does not apply to them. Beis Hillel said to Beis Shammai: But if one shakes a stalk, do we care if [water] goes from one leaf to leaf? They responded to them: [You are talking about] a singular stalk, but a bundle has many stalks! Beis Hillel responded to them: One who brings a sack full of fruit [that fell into a river and he didn't care they were wet] and put them on the side of the river, do we care that maybe [water] will go down from the top side to the lower? But two [sacks] that he put on top of each other, [the law of] Be Chi Yutan applies [because they are considered separate]. Rabbi Yose says: the bottom [sack] is pure.",

            "[The following are considered] derivatives of water [and are considered like water with regards to impurity]: [liquid] that emits from the eye, from the ear, from the nose, from the mouth, urine (lit. water of the feet), whether [it was from] an adult or a child, whether it [emitted from him] knowingly or unknowingly. Derivatives of blood: the blood of the slaughter of domesticated animals, or wild animals, or kosher birds or the blood of bloodletting used for drinking (as opposed to medicinal bloodletting). Whey is like milk [with regards to impurity]. And Machal (liquid that exudes from an olive) is considered like oil because Machal comes out with oil [in it]. These are the words of Rabbi Shimon. Rabbi Meir says: Even if there wasn't oil in it. Blood of a Sheretz (one of eight animals that there corpses spread impurity) is like its flesh and it makes [something] impure, but does not make it susceptible [to impurity] and there is [no other blood] like it [that has this unique combination of laws].",
            "The following make [something] impure and make it susceptible [to impurity]. The discharge of a Zav (one who had an abnormal discharge) and his spittle. [Also] semen, urine, a Reviit (Mishnaic volume) of [the blood of] a corpse and the blood a Nidda (menstruating woman who spreads impurity). Rabbi Eliezer says: semen does not make [something] susceptible [to impurity]. Rabbi Elazar ben Ezaria says: blood of a Nidda does not make [something] susceptible [to impurity]. Rabbi Shimon says: Blood of a corpse does not make [something] susceptible [to impurity]. And if [this blood] fell on a squash, he may scrape it off and it is still pure ",
            "The following don't make [something] impure and don't make it susceptible [to impurity]. Sweat, pus (lit. disgusting moisture), feces, the blood that comes with these [things] and blood (lit. liquid) from a baby born in the eighth [month of pregnancy, which is considered dead]. Rabbi Yose says: Except blood [of this baby, I agree with these]. (Continuing the list) And one of who drinks the water [of the hot springs] of Tevaria, even though [the water] comes out [of his body when he excretes] clean [is considered excrement]. Blood of the slaughter of domesticated animals, wild animals, and non-kosher birds and blood of medicinal bloodletting. Rabbi Eliezer would call these [the above] impure. Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says: Male milk is considered pure.",
            "A women's milk is impure whether [it emitted] with or against her will and the milk of an animal is only impure if [it emitted] with its will. Rabbi Akiva says: [The above] can be derived logically! Just like women's milk, which is only designated for children, makes impure [if it was extracted] with or against her will, milk of an animal, which is designated for children and adults, is it not logical that it should make impure [if it was extracted] with or against its will. [The sages] said to him. No, a women's milk is impure [extracted] against her will, because [it also comes with blood and] blood of a her wound is impure. Milk [extracted] from an animal against its will [is pure because] blood of its wound is pure! He responded to them: I am more stringent by blood than I am by blood because milk [extracted] for medicinal purposes is pure [while] blood [extracted] for medicinal purposes is pure. They responded to him: The basket of olives and grapes will testify [that you are wrong] because the liquid [that exudes from them] according to his will, is impure. But [those that exude] against his will are pure. He responded to them: No! How are you talking about the basket of olives and grapes that initially are [solid] food and in the end are liquid [and comparing them to] milk that both initially and finally is liquid. This was the end of his rebuttal [and the sages didn't argue any more]. Rabbi Shimon said: From here on we [Rabbi Akiva's students] presented a rebuttal, \"Let rain water prove [that you are wrong] because both initially and finally they are liquid yet they only make [something] impure according to [the owner's] will [therefore, this should also apply to animals milk].\" He said to us, \"How are you talking about rain water that most of it does not go to man but is used [as irrigation] for fields and trees [and comparing it to milk] which most of milk goes to man!\"    "
