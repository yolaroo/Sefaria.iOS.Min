            "The principal impurities: the <em>sheretz</em> [one of eight creeping creatures, whose identities are debated, and whose carcasses transmit ritual impurity upon contact], semen, that which is rendered impure by a dead body, the <em>metzora</em> [victim of a Divinely inflicted skin disease] while he is in his days of counting, a small amount of purifying water that is not enough to perform the sprinkling ceremony -  can render persons and vessels impure through touch, and pottery vessels through the air, but they do not render impure when they are carried.",
            "Higher than these: the <em>nevelah</em> [an animal which died without proper slaughter] and purifying water of which there is enough to perform the sprinkling ceremony, as they render impure a person through carrying and clothing through touch, and without clothes [on an unclothed area of a person], by touch.",
            "Higher than these: one who has intercourse with a <em>niddah</em> [a woman who is menstruating or has menstruated, but has not yet immersed], for he renders impure the bottom [layer] of what lies beneath him in like degree to the top. Higher than this: the abnormal genital discharge of a <em>zav</em> [man with an abnormal genital discharge], his spittle, his semen, and his urine, and the blood of the menstruant, for they convey impurity both by contact and by carrying. Higher than these: the impurity of a saddle, for it conveys impurity even to what lies beneath a heavy stone. Higher than a saddle: what one lies upon, since contact with it is equal to carrying it. Higher than what one lies upon: a <em>zav</em>; for a <em>zav</em> conveys impurity to what he lies upon, while what he lies upon does not convey the same level of impurity to that upon which it lies.",
            "Higher than the <em>zav</em> is the <em>zavah</em> [a woman with an abnormal genital discharge], for she conveys impurity to one who has intercourse with her. Higher than the <em>zavah</em>: the <em>metzora</em>, for he renders impure by entering. Higher than the <em>metzora</em>: bone the size of a barley grain, for it coneys seven-day impurity. More severe than all of these: a corpse, for it conveys <em>ohel</em> impurity [\"tent\" impurity; i.e., it renders objects and persons within the same overshadowed area impure], which nothing else can do. ",
            "Ten degrees of impurity are derived from a person: the one whose atonement is incomplete [who has not brought a required sacrifice] is prohibited to eat <em>kodesh</em> [portions of offerings assigned to the priests], but permitted to eat <em>terumah</em> [portion of crops, wine, etc. required to be given to a priest] and <em>ma'aser</em> [tithes]. Should he become a <em>tevul yom</em> [immerses in the day and becomes pure upon nightfall], he is forbidden to eat <em>kodesh</em> and <em>terumah</em>,  but permitted to eat <em>ma'aser</em>. Should he have a nocturnal emission, he is prohibited in all three. Should he have intercourse with a <em>niddah</em>, he transmits impurity to the bottom layer lying beneath him as he does to the top. Should he become a <em>zav</em> and has see two appearances [of discharge], he transmits impurity to the bed and the chair and needs to immerse in running water, but he is exempt from [bringing] an offering. If he sees a third [appearance], he is bound [to bring] an offering. Should he become a quarantined [suspected] <em>metzora</em>, he transmits impurity by entering [a house], but is exempt from loosening [hair], from tearing [of clothing], from shaving, and from the [offering of the] birds. But if he is declared a <em>metzora</em>, he is obligated in all of them. If a limb without enough flesh on it is separated from him, it transmits impurity through contact and through carrying, but it does not transmit impurity in a tent. And if there is enough flesh on it, then it transmits impurity through contact, and through carrying and in the tent. The measure of flesh that is sufficient is enough to bring up a scab. R. Yehuda says, If there is enough [flesh] in one place to surround it with the thread of the woof, it is able to bring up a scab. ",
            "There are ten degrees of holiness. The land of Israel is holier than any other land. Wherein lies its holiness? In that from it are brought the <em>omer</em> [barley offering brought on the second day of Passover], the first fruits, and the two loaves [offered on Shavuot], which may not be brought from any other land.",
            "The walled cities are still more holy, in that they must send forth the <em>metzoraim</em> from their midst, and they may carry around a corpse therein as far as necessary, but once it is taken out, they may not bring it back.",
            "Inside the wall [of Jerusalem] is more holy than these, because there the less holy [offerings] and the second tithe are eaten. The Temple Mount has greater sanctity, because men and women with discharges, menstruating women, and women who have given birth may not enter there. The outer wall of the Temple courtyard has higher sanctity, because gentiles and people contaminated with corpse impurity may not enter there. The women's courtyard has higher sanctity, because a <em>tevul yom</em> may not enter there, but they are not liable for a sin offering for doing so. The Israelites' courtyard has higher sanctity, because one who lacks atonement may not enter there, and is liable for a sin offering for doing so. The priests' courtyard has higher sanctity, because the Israelites may not enter there except at the time of their [ritual] requirements: the laying on of hands, the slaughter, and the wave-offering. ",
            "Between the porch and the altar has still higher sanctity, because [priests] with blemishes and loosened hair may not enter there. The sanctuary has higher sanctity, because no one may enter there who has not washed their hands and feet. The holy of holies has greater sanctity than these, because no one may enter there except the High Priest on the Day of Atonement at the time of the service. Rabbi Yose said: In five ways [the area] between the porch and the altar is equal to the sanctuary because [priests] with blemishes, loosened hair, who have consumed wine, and who have not washed their hands and feet may not enter there, and they separate themselves from between the porch and the altar at the time of [the offering of the] incense.

            "Utensils of wood, leather, bone, or glass that are flat are not susceptible to ritual impurity. If they form a receptacle they are susceptible. If they are broken, they become pure. If one then made utensils from them, they are subject to ritual impurity from then on. Earthenware vessels and vessels of alum-crystal are alike in matters of ritual impurity: they contract impurity and convey impurity through their air-space, and they contract impurity from what touches their bottoms but not from what touches their outer sides; and when they are broken they become pure.",
            "Small earthenware vessels, and bottoms and sides that can stand without support, [can become ritually impure] if their size is enough to hold oil to anoint a small child, up to a <em>log</em>.  From a <em>log</em> to a <em>seah</em>, [they can contract ritual impurity if they can still hold] a <em>revi'it</em> [quarter of a <em>log</em>. From a <em>seah</em> to two <em>seahs</em>, [if they can still hold] half a <em>log</em>. From two <em>seahs</em> to three, and up to five <em>seahs</em>, [if they can still hold] a <em>log</em>: the words of Rabbi Yishmael. Rabbi Akiva says: I would not prescribe any measure for the vessels; small earthenware vessels, and bottoms and sides that can stand without support, the size [at which they can contract ritual impurity] from a size large enough [to hold oil] to anoint a small child up to a small cooking pot. From small cooking pots to Lydda jars, [they can contract ritual impurity if they can still hold] a <em>revi'it</em>; from Lydda jars to Bethlehem jars, a half-<em>log</em>; from Bethlem jars to large storage jars, [if they can still hold] one <em>log</em>. Rabban Yochanan ben Zakkai says: The measure for large storage jars is two <em>lugin</em>; for the bottoms of Galilean flasks and small vessels, any amount; but their sides are not [susceptible to impurity].",
            "Among earthenware utensils, these are not susceptible to ritual impurity: a tray without a rim, a breached fire-pan, a tube for parched corn, gutter spouts, even if they are bent or even if they retain [water], a clay lid that is used as a bread basket, a pitcher made to be used for grapes, a jar for swimmers, a jar let into the sides of a ladling-jar, a bed, a stool, a bench, a table, a ship, an earthenware lampstand; these are not susceptible ritual impurity. This is the rule: Any earthenware vessel that does not have an inside cannot contract impurity from its outside. ",
            "If a lantern [of earthenware] has a reservoir for oil it is susceptible to impurity; if it has not, it is not susceptible. A potter's mold with which he begins [to shape the clay] is not susceptible to impurity; but that with which he finishes it is susceptible. A funnel belonging to householders is not susceptible to impurity, but one that belongs to peddlers is susceptible, since it serves also as a measure: the words of Rabbi Yehudah ben Beteira. But Rabbi Akiva says: because he lays it on its side to let the buyer smell it. ",
            "The covers of wine-jars and oil-jars and the cover of papyrus jars are not susceptible to impurity, but if they were adapted for another use they are susceptible. If the cover of a stew pot has a hole in it or if it has a pointed top, it is not susceptible to uncleanness; if there is no hole in it or it has not a pointed top, it is susceptible, because she drains the vegetables into it. Rabbi Eliezer ben Zadok says: Because she turns out the contents on to it. ",
            "If a defective jar was found in the furnace before its manufacture was complete it is not susceptible to ritual impurity; but after its completion, it is susceptible. A sprinkler Rabbi Eliezer ben Zadok declares insusceptible to impurity, but Rabbi Yose declares it susceptible because it only lets the liquid out in drops.",
            "Among earthenware vessels these are susceptible to ritual impurity: a tray with a rim, an unbroken firepan, and a tray that is made up of several dishes. If one of them was rendered impure by a <em>sheretz</em> [one of several creeping creatures], they are not all rendered impure; but if the tray had a rim that was higher [than the component dishes], and one dish was rendered impure, all become impure. So too, with an earthenware spice-pot, or a double inkstand. But if one part in a wooden spice-pot is rendered unclean by a liquid, the other is not rendered unclean. Rabbi Yochanan ben Nuri says: they divide the thickness of the partition and the half that serves the impure part is considered impure, and the half that serves the pure part is considered pure. But if it had a higher rim, and one part was rendered impure, the other part becomes impure also.",
            "A torch is susceptible to ritual impurity, and the reservoir of a lamp is susceptible to impurity from its air-space. The comb-shaped filter of a water-cooler Rabbi Eliezer declares insusceptible to impurity; but the Sages declare it susceptible."

            "Concerning a jug, its measure [of a hole large enough to render it ritually pure] is with dried figs, [these are] the words of Rabbi Shimon. Rabbi Yehudah says, with nuts. Rabbi Meir says, with olives. Concerning a stew pot and a cooking pot, their measure is with olives. Concerning an [oil] cruse and a pitcher, their measure is with oil. Concerning a jug [for oil or wine], its measure is with water. Rabbi Shimon says, concerning these three, [their measure] is with seeds. Concerning a lamp, its measure is with oil. R. Eliezer says \"with a small peturah.\"  Concerning a lamp whose spout has been taken, it is clean. And one [made] of clay whose spout is burned by the wick, it is clean.   ",
            "A jug which had a hole which was repaired with pitch, and it was then broken: if there is in the place of the pitch [an area large] enough to hold a <em>revi'it</em>, it is still impure because it did not lose the status of a vessel.  If it was made of earthenware and it was pierced and repaired with pitch, even if it holds a <em>revi'it</em> it is pure because it lost the status of a vessel. ",
            "A jar that is broken, and it is plastered with dung, even if when the dung is removed the shards will fall apart, [can become] impure because it retains the status of a vessel. If it was broken and shards from it are stuck together, or shards are brought from another place and plastered with dung, even if when the dung is removed the shards remain together, it is pure, because it has lost the status of a vessel. If there is a shard that can hold a <em>revi'it</em>, the whole [vessel] is susceptible to impurity by contact, and [what is] opposite from it is made impure through the air. ",
            "If an intact clay vessel is plastered, Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Shimon [declare] it susceptible to impurity. The Sages say, if an intact clay vessel is plastered, it is not subject to impurity. And an unsound vessel  may become impure [if plastered].  And so also for the [clay] lining of a gourd. ",

            "If a vessel for heating water is plastered with potter's clay or kaolin, whatever touches the clay is subject to impurity, but whatever touches the kaolin is not subject to impurity. A kettle that was perforated and repaired with pitch, Rabbi Yose [declares it] pure because it is not able to hold hot water as [it can hold] cold [water]. And so he says with regard to vessels of pitch. Vessels of copper plastered with pitch, they are pure. But if [they are] for wine, they are subject to impurity. ",
            "A jar which was perforated and repaired with more pitch than needed, whatever touches the [pitch that is] necessary may become impure.  [Whatever touches] the extra pitch remains pure. Pitch that drops on a jar, whatever touches it is pure. A funnel [made of] wood or of clay which is plugged with pitch, Rabbi Eliezer ben Azariah declares it subject to become impure. Rabbi Akiva declares it subject to become impure if it is of wood, but not if it is of clay. Rabbi Yose declares both of them pure. "

If the handle broke off or the point was broken off, it is pure. Rabbi Yehudah says it is impure [i.e., capable of contracting ritual impurity]. A jug which lost a piece but can still contain with its sides, or became divided like two troughs - Rabbi Yehudah says it is pure, but the Sages say it is impure.  ",
            "A jug which broke and cannot be carried while holding half a <em>kav</em> of dried figs is pure. A defective vessel which cracked and can no longer hold liquids, even though it can still hold food, is pure, because a broken utensil cannot be considered to become further broken. ",
            "What is considered a defective vessel?  Any whose handles were broken off. If it had hollow knobs, if it can hold olives it can become impure by touching and can make things opposite it impure through the air. If it cannot hold olives it can become impure by touching but does not make things opposite it impure.  If it was laying on its side like a <em>katedra</em> chair - if it can hold olives, it can become impure by touching and can make things opposite it impure through the air; if it cannot hold olives, it can become impure by touching but does not make things opposite it impure through the air. The bottom of a pointed vessel and the bottom of Sidonian cups, even though they cannot rest without support, they are impure because they were made this way. ",
            "An earthenware vessel that has three lips, if the inner one extends, everything is pure; if the outer one extends, everything is impure.  If the middle one extends, from it to the inside is impure, and from it to the outside is pure.  If they were all even, Rabbi Yehudah says the middle one is divided, but the Sages say the entire vessel is pure. When does an earthenware vessel become susceptible to impurity? When it is fired in the kiln, and this completes its work. "

The Sages say, this is only true regarding a large oven; regarding a small oven, however, it beginning [point] is any [size] and its remainder is a majority [of its size] once its manufacture has been completed. What is the completion of its manufacture? Once it is kindled enough to bake a sponge cake in it. Rabbi Yehudah says, once it is kindled enough to bake a sponge cake [as] in an old oven.",
            "A stove's minimum size [to become ritually impure] is three [<em>tefachim</em> in height] and its remainder [that remains impure when it is broken] is three [<em>tefachim</em>, once its manufacture is complete. What is the completion of its manufacture? When it is kindled enough to cook the easiest-cooking of eggs on it, scrambled and placed in a pot. A <em>kupach</em> [small stove or brazier] that is made to bake has the same measurement requirements as an oven. If it was made to cook, its measurement requirements are that of a stove. A stone that protrudes a <em>tefach</em> from the oven or a distance of three fingers from a stove is connected. If it protrudes from a <em>kupach</em> made for baking, the measurement is that of the oven. If from a <em>kupach</em> made to cook, its measurement is that of a stove. Rabbi Yehudah says, they did not say tefach except [when the protrusion is] between the oven and the wall. If there were two ovens next to each other, give each one a <em>tefach</em> and the rest is pure.",
            "The rim of a stove is pure. The surrounding brickwork of an oven, when it is [at least] four Tefachim (Mishnaic length) tall, becomes impure through [an impure object's] touch or through [the object] in its air[space]. Less than this, it is pure. If it is attached [to the oven], even if on three stones, it is impure. The holder for an oil jug, the holder for a spicebox or the holder of a light on a stove, become impure through [an impure object's] contact [with the stove] but are not impure through its air[space]. These are the words of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yishmael says they are pure.",
            "An oven that was heated from its outside, or that was that was heated without intent to complete it, or that was heated [while still] in the craftsman's house, is susceptible to impurity. There was a story that a fire fell on the ovens of Kfar Signa, and the story came to Yavneh, and Raban Gamliel ruled them susceptible to impurity.",
            "The extension on a householder's oven [a thick rim on top] is pure. But that of a baker's oven is impure because he rests a spit on it. Rabbi Yochanan Hasandlar says: [It is impure] because he bakes with it [by placing dough on the inside of the rim] when he is pressured. Similarly, the extension of an olive cooker's cauldron is impure. But that of a dyer's cauldron is pure.",
            "An oven half filled with earth - the part from the earth downwards contracts impurity by contact; the part from the earth upwards contracts impurity [also] from its air-space. If the oven is placed over the mouth of a cistern or over that of a cellar and a stone is placed at its side:  Rabbi Yehudah says: if when heated from below it becomes also heated above it is susceptible to impurity. But the Sages say: since it was heated in any case it is susceptible to impurity.   ",
            "An oven which contracted impurity - how is it purified?  It is divided into three parts and the plastering is scraped off so that [the oven] touches the ground. Rabbi Meir says: it is not necessary to scrape off the plastering nor is it necessary for [the oven] to touch the ground. Rather he reduces it within to a height of less than four <em>tefachim</em>.  Rabbi Shimon says: it must be moved [from its position]. If it is divided into two parts, one large and the other small, the larger remains impure and the smaller becomes pure. If it is divided into three parts one of which was as big as the other two together, the big one remains impure and the two small ones become pure. ",
            "If [the oven] is cut up by its width into rings that are each less than four <em>tefachim</em> in height, it is pure.  If it is subsequently plastered over with clay, it becomes susceptible to impurity when it is heated to a degree that is enough for baking sponge cakes.  If he distanced the plastering, and he put sand or gravel between it and the oven sides — of such an oven they said, \"A menstruant as well as a ritually pure woman may bake in it and it remains ritually pure.\"  ",

If a hole was made in it, or if it was damaged or cracked, and lined with plaster or with a rim of clay, it is subject to impurity. What must be the size of the hole [for it to be pure]? It must be big enough for the flame to come through.  The same applies also to a stove: a stove of stone or of metal is not subject to impurity [according to the laws for a stove]. But [the metal one] is subject to impurity as a metal vessel. If a hole was made in it or if it was damaged or cracked but he made props for it, it is impure.

One who makes a stove of two stones, and joins them [to the ground] with clay, it is susceptible to impurity.

The extension around a stove, whenever it is three finger-breadths high, contracts impurity by contact and also through its air-space, but if it is less than this it contracts impurity through contact and not through its air-space.

And similarly he used to say concerning the stopper of a jar which was pierced: The minimum size is the circumference of the second knot in a rye stalk. If the hole was in the middle the stalk must be able to enter, and if at the side it need not be able to enter. And similarly he used to say concerning large stone jars whose stoppers became pierced. The minimum size is the circumference of the second knot in a reed. If the hole was in the middle the reed must be able to enter it, and if it was at the side the reed need not be able to enter it.

When the holes were not made by a person, but if they were made by a person, if they have even the smallest hole, they are impure.
