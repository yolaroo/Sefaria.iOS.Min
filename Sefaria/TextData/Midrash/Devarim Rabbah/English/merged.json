            "\"And I besought the Lord\" (Deuteronomy 3:23). Halacha: A Jew who stands and prays [the Amidah prayer], may he pray out loud? The sages teach: (Talmud Berachot 31a) \"Someone who stands and prays [the Amidah prayer] should hear his own voice [but others should not]. Chanah alrady explained: (I Samuel 1:13) \"And Chanah spoke to herself...\" One might think one can pray the three [Amidah prayers throughout the day] as a single [prayer]? Daniel already taught: (Daniel 6:11) \"And three times a day he would kneel on his knees, and he would pray and bow before his god.\" One might think that one should pray at every moment one fancies? David already explained: (Psalms 55:18) \"Evening, morning and afternoon I speak and moan, and He hearkened to my voice.\"",

            "Halacha: Is it permissible to divide up the public reading of the curses amongst several people? Are rabbis have taught us: the curses must be read without interruption, one person only reading them all. Our rabbis have taught us: why is it not permitted to interrupt the reading of the curses? Rabbi Joshua of Sikhnin said in the name of Rabbi Levi: the Holy One, blessed be God, says: \"I have written concerning myself, I will be with him in trouble\" (Psalm 91:15): it would not be fair that My children should be cursed and I be blessed.\" How could this come about? Should the reading of the curses be frequently interrupted then everyone called to the reading would have to recite to benedictions, one before it, and one after it; therefore only one should read them all. The rabbis say: God said: \"I did not give Israel the blessings in the curses for their hurt, but only to show them the good way which they should choose in order to receive reward.\"",

            "(Deuteronomy 16:18) \"You shall appoint judges and officers in all your towns that the Lord your God is giving you, according to your tribes, and they shall judge the people with righteous judgment.\" - Halacha: Can one sit in judgement for one's relative? Such taught the sages: These are the relatives: his father, his brother, his paternal uncle, his maternal uncle, etc. Why is this so? Because just like a relative is invalid to testify [regarding him], so too he is invalid to judge. What did you see to say this? Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai said: It is written (Deuteronomy 21:5), \"Then the priests, the sons of Levi, shall come forward, for the Lord your God has chosen them to minister to him and to bless in the name of the Lord, and by their word every dispute and every skin affliction shall be settled.\" - Come and see the relationship between skin afflictions and disputes. Just like skin afflictions [are examined] during the day, so too judgement [are done] during the day. Just like disputes are to the exclusion of relatives [as witnesses], so too skin afflictions are to the exclusion of relatives [as examiners]. Rabbi Shimon ben Gamliel said: Do not mock the law, for it is one of the three legs of the world. Why? For the sages taught, (Pirkei Avot 1:18) \"On three things the world stands: On law, on truth, and on peace.\" Pay attention that if you pervert the law, you have shocked the world, for it is one of its legs. Our rabbis say: The power of the law is fierce, for it is one of the legs of the Chair of Glory. How do we know? (Psalms 89:15) \"Righteousness and justice are the foundation of your throne; love and faithfulness go before you.\" The Holy One, blessed be He, says: Since the punishment of the law is fierce, be careful. From where do we know this? From that which we read on the subject, (Deuteronomy 16:18) \"Judges and officers.\"",

            "(Deuteronomy 17:14) \"When you enter the land...\" - Halacha: A king who has a business dealing, can he be judged before a Bet Din? Thus teaches our sages: A king does not judge, nor is judged. He does not testify, nor is testified about. Our rabbis learned: Why can he not be judged? Rabbi Yirmiya said: For it is written by King David, (Psalms 17:2) \"Let my sentence come forth from before You...\" This means no living thing may judge the king, except for the Holy One, blessed be He. Our rabbis say: The Holy One, blessed be He, said to Israel, \"My children! I have thought to let you free from kingship.\" How do we know? For it is stated, (Jeremiah 2:24), \"A wild donkey that is used to the wilderness [sniffing the wind in its desire]...\" Just like a wild donkey grows up in the wilderness and doesn't fear man, so have I thought that you should not have the fear of kingship upon you. But you did not want that, but rather \"sniffing the wind in its desire...\", and \"wind\" refers only to kingship. How do we know? For it is stated, (Daniel 7:2) \"...the four winds of heaven stirred up the great sea.\" Said the Holy One, blessed be He: And if you say that I don't know that you will end up abandoning Me, I have already warned you through Moses, and I said to him: Since they will end up requesting a human king, from their own shall they crown a king, not from the nations. How do we know this? From that which we read on the subject, (Deuteronomy 17:14) - \"And you will say, 'I will appoint for myself a king.'\"",
            "This is what Scripture says: (Job 34:30) \"That the godless should not reign, lest the people be trapped (memokshei am).\" [An argument between] Rabbi Yochanan and Reish Lakish: Rabbi Yochanan says, \"If you see a godless and wicked person as the leader of the generation, it would be better for the generation to fly into the air and not to serve him, and the language of \"memokshei am\" only means to be trapped, as it similarly says (Amos 3:5) \"Can a bird fall into a trap if there is no lure (mokesh) for it?\". \"That the godless should not reign...\" Our rabbis stated: Once kings were appointed in Israel, they started to be enslave them. Says the Holy One, blessed be He, \"You haven't abandoned Me, yet you want kings?\" That's what it means, (Deuteronomy 17:14) \"I will appoint for myself a king.\" This is what Scripture says: (Psalms 146:3) \"Do not place trust in important people...\" Rabbi Simon said in the name of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi: Anyone who trusts in God merits to be like Him. How do we know? As it says: (Jeremiah 17:7) \"Blessed is the man who trusts in the Lord, and whose hope is the Lord.\" But anyone who places trusts in pagan worship, he becomes indebted to be like it. How do we know? As it says, (Psalms 115:8) \"May they who make them become like them, [and everyone who trusts in them.]\" Our rabbis said: Anyone who relies on man transgresses, even for his protection, he transgresses, for it says, (Psalms 146:3), \"...in humans who cannot save.\" What does it say afterwards? (Psalms 146:4) \"His breath goes forth, he returns to his earth.\" Says the Holy One, blesses be He: They know that humans are nothing, yet they put aside My Glory and say: \"Appoint for us a king\"? What do you want a king for? By your lives, your end will be to feel what will happen to you in the future under the reign of your kings!\" How do we know? As it says, (Hosea 7:7) \"All their kings have fallen; there is none among them who call me.\"",
            "Alternatively: (Deuteronomy 17:14) \"And you will say, 'I will appoint for me a king...\" - Rabbi Yehudah said in the name of Rabbi Ilai: Israel was commanded about three things in their entrance to the land, and these are they: to erase the memory of Amalek, to appoint for them a king, and to build for them the Holy Temple. They appointed a king and they erased the memory of Amalek, why did they not [immediately] build the Holy Temple? Because there were informers amongst them. You should know, that Rabbi Shmuel bar Nachman said: Achav's generation were pagan worshippers, yet they went out to war and won. Why was this so? Because they did not have informers amongst them. Therefore they went out to war and won. You should know that when Ezevel wanted to murder all of the prophets of God, what did Ovadia do? He hid them in caves, as it says, (I Kings 18:13) \"...how I hid a hundred men if the Lord's prophets by fifties in a cave...\" And there wasn't anybody who told Achav, \"Such and such did Ovadia do.\" But in Shaul's generation, they were all informers. You should know, that when Shaul was chasing after David, they all tattled to Shaul, as it says, (Psalms 52:2) \"When Doeg the Adamite came...\" (Psalms 54:2) \"When the Ziphites came and said to Shaul...\" Therefore, they fell in war. Differently: Said Rabbi Minah: Anyone who speaks ill [of others] causes the Presence to leave from below to above. You should know, what does David say? (Psalms 57:5) \"My soul is among lions; I must lie among those who breathe forth fire, Even the sons of men, whose teeth are spears and arrows And their tongue a sharp sword.\" And what does it state afterwards? (Psalms 57:6) \"Be exalted, O God, above the heavens...\" Said David, \"Master of the World! What is the Presence doing below? Remove the Presence to the firmament!\" Differently: Said Rabbi Shmuel bar Nachman: Why is speaking ill of others called \"the third speaking\"? Because it murders three: The speaker, the accepter, the person spoken about. How do we know this? Doeg the speaker, Shaul the accepter, and Nov, the city of priests that was spoken about. Alternatively: Said Rabbi Shmuel bar Nachman: They asked the snake, \"Why are you found amongst the fences?\" It responded, \"For I breached the fence of the world!\" They said to him, \"Why do you walk on the ground and have your tongue drink up the ground?\" He said, \"It was caused to me for I spoke ill about the Creator.\" \"What was his ill speaking? Rabbi Yehoshua of Siknin said in the name of Rabbi Levi, \"The first snake spoke like a human. Since Adam and Eve did not want to eat from that tree, it began to speak ill of its Creator. It said: The Creator ate from that tree and created His world, so He commanded you not to eat from it and create another world (Cf. Genesis 3:5). So what did the Holy One, blessed be He, do? He cut off its legs, and mutilated its tongue so that it could not speak. Alternatively: They asked the snake, \"How do you benefit, that you bite so?\" It said, \"Before you ask me why, ask why of those who speak ill of others!\" As its says, (Ecclesiastes 10:11) \"If the snake bites before it is charmed, there is no advantage to the person who speaks [ill of others] (alt: charmer).\" How did he benefit? By speaking ill of others. Alternatively: They said to the snake, \"Why do you bite one limb, yet your poison spreads to all the limbs?\" It said to them, \"Before you ask me why, ask why of those who speak ill of others, who stand in Rome and murder in Syria, who stand in Syria and murder in Rome!\" Come and see how harsh the power of ill speech is, that they were commanded to build a Holy Temple, but because their generation spoke ill of others, it was not built in their day.",
            "Alternatively: (Deuteronomy 17:14) \"And you will say, 'I will appoint for me a king...\" - Our rabbis said: Said the Holy One, blessed be He, \"You want kings in this world. Jewish kings will be appointed, and they will make you fall by the sword.\" Shaul caused them to fall at Mt. HaGilboa. How do we know? (I Samuel 4:17) \"And Israel fled from before the Philistines...\" David caused a plague to be sent, as it says, (II Samuel 24:15) \"And God sent a pestilence to Israel...\" Achav stopped up the rains from them, as it says (I Kings 17:1) \"...there shall not be dew nor rain these years...\" Tzidkiyahu caused the destruction of the Holy Temple. Once Israel saw what happens under the rule of their kings, they all began to cry out, \"We don't want a king of Israel! We want our furst King: (Isaiah 33:22) \"For God is our judge, God is our law-giver, God is our king, He will save us!\" The Holy One, blessed be He, said to them, \"By your lives, thus will I do.\" How do we know? As it says, (Zachariah 14:9) \"And God will be the king over all the earth...\"",

            "Who fulfilled this section (Deuteronomy 20:10-15)? Yehoshua bin Nun. Said Rabbi Shmuel bar Nachman: What did Yehoshua do? He put out an edict everywhere he went to conquer, and this is what was written in it: \"Anyone who wants to leave, can leave. Anyone who wants to make peace, make it. Anyone who wants to wage war, wage it.\" What did the Gergashites do? They turned and left from before them, giving the Holy One, blessed be He, a land as beautiful as His land, called Africa. The Gibeonites made peace him, Yehoushua made peace with them. But the 31 kings came to wage war with him, the Holy One, blessed be He, made them fall into his hand. How do we know? As it says, (Deuteronomy 3:3) \"We struck them down, leaving no survivors.\"",

Rab Huna said: If he errs during the middle 3 blessings, he goes back to \"the Holy God\" [blessing].
