            "You will find that the numerical value of the letters in hstn [Satan], “the Adversary,” is three hundred and sixty-four, which is one short of the number of days in the year.  Thus the Adversary is given the authority to make accusations against the children of Israel on all the days of the year except the Day of Atonement, for the Holy One said to him, “you have no authority to touch them.  Nevertheless, go and see what they are occupied with.”  Then, when the Adversary goes forth and finds all of them at fasting and prayer, dressed in white [penitential] garments and cloaked like the ministering angels, he immediately returns in shame and confusion.  The Holy One asks him, “What have you found out about My children?”  He answers, “They are like the ministering angels, and I am unable to touch them.”  At once, the Holy One shackles the adversary and announces to the children of Isreal, “I have forgiven you.”"
