            "Our teachers have said: Once, while Moses our Teacher was tending [his father-in-law] Yitro’s sheep, one of the sheep ran away. Moses ran after it until it reached a small, shaded place. There, the lamb came across a pool and began to drink. As Moses approached the lamb, he said, “I did not know you ran away because you were thirsty. You are so exhausted!” He then put the lamb on his shoulders and carried him back. The Holy One said, “Since you tend the sheep of human beings with such overwhelming love - by your life, I swear you shall be the shepherd of My sheep, Israel.”...",

            "\"These are the laws...\" - That's is what is written, (Psalms 99:4) \"The King is mighty, He loves justice (lit. law).\" When is might given to the Holy One, blessed be He? When He does justice to the gentiles. For so was it manifest at Nebuchadnezzar the wicked, because he became haughty and said, (Daniel 4:27) \"Is this Babylon not great?\" The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him, \"Wicked one! You, putrid spit, become haughty and say, (ibid.) \"The strength of my power and the honor of my majesty\"? [Do you] not know that all is Mine? Greatness is mine! Power is Mine! Honor is Mine! Majesty is Mine! So did David say, (I Chronicles 29:11) \"To You, O God, is greatness, and strength, and majesty...\" And he says, (Psalms 104:1) \"God, my God, You are very great...\" Said the Holy One, blessed be He to Nebuchadnezzar, \"The little kingship given to you is Mine.\" And so Daniel said to him, (Daniel 2:37) \"For the God of heaven has given you a kingdom, power, strength, and glory.\" - And you say 'the strength of my power and the honor of my majesty'?! Really, \"the King is mighty, He loves justice\", the might of the king of all kings, the Holy One, blessed be He, Who loves justice and gave it to Israel Whom He loves. And that which is written, (Psalms 99:4) \"You have established fairness\" - you have established fairness for your those who love you. For through the laws you gave them, they fight each other, and come for judgement, and then they make peace. Israel said before the Holy One, blessed be He: Master of the world! Until when will You withhold judgment from the gentiles? [God] said to them: When their iniquities fully ripen, as it says (Isaiah 27:2) \"In that day, chant about the fruitful vineyard!\" Does anyone pick his vineyard before it is fully ripe?! Rather after it is ripe, he picks it and puts it into the vat, and then he treads on it [to press it] and sings, and they chant responsively. So did the Holy One, blessed be He, say to Israel: Wait for Me, until Edom's iniquities become [ripe], and I will tread on it, as it states, (Psalms 60:10) \"On Edom I toss My sandal.\" I will open for you and you will respond after me. Therefore it says (Isaiah 27:2) \"In that day, chant about the fruitful vineyard!\" and (Isaiah 27:3) \"I the Lord guard it, I water it every moment.\" I am the one who watches over her to make her drink many cups, as it says, ‘I water it every moment.’ If I but come and glance at them, I obliterate them from the world, but \"Anger is not in Me,\" (Isaiah 27:4) but they are filled with anger against My children. But what will I do to them? \"I step forward and set them all on fire\" (ibid.). Rabbi Levi said: God said to the idolators: ' Israel is Mine, as it says, \"For the children of Israel are Mine as servants  (Leviticus 25:55), and anger is Mine, as it says, \"God avenges and is the master of wrath\" (Nahum 1:2), and you are filled with what is Mine against Mine?!’ As it says, Who will give me thorns and thistles will be at war! (Isaiah 27:4) Our Rabbis said that God said to them: ' If I were to change My measured way of Judgment, I would obliterate  them in a single flash of lighting, as it says, \"If I sharpen (or, 'change') the flash of My sword\" (Deut. 32:41) But what do I do? \"My hand grabs hold of Justice'  (ibid). It also says, \"Or let him take hold of My strength (Isaiah 27:5), and 'My strength' means Judgment, as it says, \"And strength to the king who loves Justice.\" (Psalms. 99:4) God said to Israel, ‘Just as I could overstep the bounds of judgment on the idolators, but I do not overstep them but hold on to judgment, so too, you must not go out of the bounds of judgment,’ as it says, \"And these are the laws.\"",
