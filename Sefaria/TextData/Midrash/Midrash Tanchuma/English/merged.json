                "<b>In the beginning God created.</b> This is per the verse (Prov. 3:19): \"God with wisdom founded the earth\" and when the Holy One Blessed Be He created His world, he consulted the Torah and created His World, as it says (Prov. 8:14) \"I have counsel and sound wisdom, I am understanding, I have strength.\" And with what was the Torah written? With black flame on white flame, as it is said (Song of Songs 5:11) \"his hair is wavy, black as a raven.\" What is meant by קוצותיו תלתלים (\"his hair is wavy\")? That on every קוצ (thorn)^(that is, every serif of every letter of the Torah) hang  תילי תילים (locks and locks) of laws. How so? It is written in it [the Torah] (Lev. 22:32): And do not desecrate [תחללו] My holy Name. If you change the [ח] to a [ה] you destroy the world ^(by making techalelu into tehalelu, and making the verse mean do not praise My holy Name). \"Every soul shall praise [תהלל] God\" (Psalms 150:6), if you change the [ה] a [ח] ^(techalel - shall desecrate) you destroy the world. Likewise, (Deut. 6:4) \"Hear O'Israel, the Lord is our God, the Lord is One [אחד].\" If you change the [ד] to a [ר] you destroy the world, as it is said (Exo. 34:14) \"You will not bow down to other gods.\" [Elsewhere it is stated] (Jer. 5:12) \"They have belied Hashem.\"  If you change the [ב] to a [כ] you destroy the world. [Elsewhere it is stated] (Shmuel I 2:2) \"There is none holy as Hashem.\"  If you change the [כ] to a [ב] you destroy the world. And if just a letter is like this, how much more so a whole word. For this is it stated, \"his locks are like tresses.\" Therefore Dovid praised and said, (Psalms 119:96) \"Your commandment is exceedingly broad.\" [Likewise] it is said (Iyov 11:9) \"the measure thereof is longer than the earth...\" And it [the Torah] was the guide for all creation, as it is said (Prov. 8:30) \"then I was by Him, as a nursling.\" Do not read it as אמון [nurseling], but rather as אומן [guide].",

And there are those that say a horn was affixed to his [Kayin's] forehead. When Kayin killed Hevel, [Hevel] was discarded [on the ground] and Kayin did not know what to do. So the Holy One, Blessed is He, sent him two pure birds and one of them killed his fellow, and then dug the earth with its claws and buried it [the dead bird]. From this Kayin learned and dug and buried Hevel. Therefore, the birds have merited that their blood be covered [with earth].",

Akiva said: Even branches for the elephants, and little shards of glass for the ostriches, they brought it with their hands to feed them. Now some animals ate in the second hour of the night and some in the third hour of the day, hence you know that Noah did not taste a bit of sleep. R. Yochanan said: One time, when Noah was late in feeding the lion, the lion attacked him, and he went away limping..."

                "Let our rabbis teach us: one who passes before the ark [i.e., serves as precentor for the 'amidah] and errs by not mentioning the birkat haminim--from whence do we know that we make him repeat the prayer? That is what the rabbis taught: One who passes before the ark and errs in any or all of the blessings, we do not make him repeat the prayer. But if he errs in the birkat haminim, we make him repeat and recite it against his will. And why do we make him repeat it? We are concerned lest he is a min, for if he has some aspect of minut, he will curse himself and the congregation will answer \"amen.\""

Therefore, it was given in the desert. Another reason it was given in the desert: Just like the desert is not planted and worked, so to is it with the one who accepts Torah upon himself. The yoke of rulership and the yoke of the ways of the world are removed from him. And just like the desert doesn't incur agricultural taxes, so to, men of Torah are are free men in this world. Another interpretation: Who fulfills the Torah? He who makes himself like a desert and detaches himself from everything.  ",

                "(7) \"And they came near the daughters of Zelophehad.\" (Numbers 27:1) -  During this generation women were fencing in that on which men were breaking down fences. Thus you find Aaron told them, \"Break off the gold rings\" (Exodus 32:2), and the women did not want to and they protested against their husbands, as it says, \"and all the nation broke off the golden rings which were in their ears\" (Exodus 32:3), and women did not participate in the incident of the calf.  And so too, in the incident of the spies, [the women] did not participate \"and when [the spies] returned, they caused all the congregation to murmur against [Moses]\" (Numbers 14:36), and they decreed a decree, as they said, \"we can not go up\" (Numbers 13:31), but the women were not in agreement with them, just as is written above regarding the matter: \"because God had said of them: 'they will surely die in the wilderness' and there was not left of them a man\" (Numbers 26:65) - \"a man\" and not a woman, for they did not want to enter to the Land, but the women became close by seeking a portion in the Land. And thus this episode was written next to [the death of Miriam], from which the men broke down fences and women erected fences. "
