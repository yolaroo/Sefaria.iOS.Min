            "The Great Rabbi Hoshaya opened with the following: \"I will be faithful to Him and I will be a plaything to Him every day...\" (Proverbs 8:30). Faithful, meaning: nanny. Faithful, meaning: covered. Faithful, meaning: hidden. And there is one who says: Faithful, meaning: great.  Faithful meaning nanny, as it is used (in Bamidbar 11:12), \"as a nanny (omen) carries the suckling child.\"  Faithful meaning covered, as it is used (in Lamentations 4:5), \"they that were brought up (emunim) in scarlet.  Faithful meaning hidden, as it is used (in Esther 2:7), \"And he hid away (omen) Hadassah, that is, Esther.\" Faithful meaning great, as it is used (in Nahum 3:8), \"Are you better than No-amon, which dwells among the rivers,\" and they translate it, \"Are you better than Alexandria the Great, which dwells between the rivers.\"  Another interpretation: faithful meaning artisan.  The Torah says: 'I was the artisan's tool of the Holy One, blessed be He'.  Similarly, as concerns a king of flesh and blood who builds a castle.  He does not build it from his own knowledge, rather from the knowledge of an architect, and the architect does not build it from his own knowledge, rather he has plans and descriptions so that he knows how he will make rooms or marbled halls.  Thus did the Holy One, blessed be He,  consult the Torah and create the world.  And the Torah said \"In the beginning God created\" and there is no beginning (reishit) except for Torah, as it is written: \"God made me the beginning of His way\" (Proverbs 8:22).",
            "Rabbi Joshua of Sichnin in the name of Rabbi Levi opened with: \"The power of his works he told to his people...\" (Psalms 111:6).  What is referred to here that God revealed to Israel?  That which God created on the first day, and that which God created on the second day, due to idolaters and star-worshipers - so that they will not classify Israel and say to them: 'Surely you are a nation of thieves.'   And Israel would reply, saying: 'Surely she [Torah] was wasted in your hands, behold: \"The Caphtorim dwelling in Caphtor were destroyed, and they dwelt in their stead\" (Deuteronomy 2:23).  The world and all that is in it belongs to God, and when God wanted to God gave it to you [the nations of the world], and when God wanted to God took it from you and gave it to us [Israel].  As it is written: \"To give them a portion of the nations\" (Psalms 111:6), thus God told them [Israel] all of the generations.",
            "\"In the beginning God created...\" Rabbi Tanchuma opened (with a verse from Psalms 86:10): \"For You are great, and you perform wonders....\" Rabbi Tanchum said: with a pouch, if you puncture a hole in its side with a pin, all its air comes out of it.  Whereas the person is made with all kinds of hollows and holes, and his air does not leave his body.  Who could make such a thing? \"....You, God, alone.\"[the second half of the verse] When were the angels created?  Rabbi Yochanan said: the angels were created on the second day. Just as it says (in Psalms 104:4), \"He sets the rafters of the upper chambers in the water...\" [creating the sky in the upper waters which God does on the second day] and then it is written, \"He makes the winds his messengers (or, 'his angels').\"  Rabbi Chanina said: the angels were created on the fifth day, where it is written \"and let the bird fly (ye-ofef) across the earth,\" and (in Isaiah 6:2) it is written, \"and with two [wings] he (the Seraphic angel) would fly (ye-ofef).\"  Rabbi Luliana bar Tavrin said in the name of Rabbi Yitzchak: whether according to the opinion of Rabbi Chanina, or whether according to the opinion of Rabbi Yochanan, all agree that they were not created on the first day - so that they could not say that the angl Michael stretched out the south end of the sky and Gabriel the north end, and the Holy One, Blessed be He, measured out the middle.  Rather, (as it says in Isaiah 44:24), \"I am God who makes all, and who alone stretches out the heavens...with only Myself (me-iti)\"  'Mi iti' (who, with me) is written, meaning, \"WHO partnered WITH ME in the creation of the world?!?\"  Another interpretation: \"For You are great and You do wonders...\" It is the way of the world that a king of flesh and blood is praised in the land, and the great men of the land are praised with him, for they carry his burden with him.  But the Holy One, Blessed be He, is not like this.  Rather, He alone created the world.  He alone is praised in the world. He alone is glorified in his world.  Rabbi Tanchuma said: \"For you are great and You do wonders...\" Why? Because, \"...You, God, alone.\"  You, alone, created the world.",
            "\"In the beginning of God's creating...\" - Six things preceded the creation of the world; some of them were created and some of them were decided to be created. The Torah and the Throne of Glory were created. How do we know the Torah was? As it says (Proverbs 8:22): \"God made me at the beginning of his way.\" How do we know the Throne of Glory was? As it says (Psalms 93:2): \"Your throne is established as of old etc.\" The Patriarchs, Israel, the Temple, and the name of the Messiah were decided to be created. How do we know the Patriarchs were? As it says (Hosea 9:10): \"Like grapes in the wilderness etc.\" How do we know Israel was? As it says (Psalms 74:2): \"Remember your congregation, whom you purchased from old.\" How do we know the Temple was? As it says (Jeremiah 17:12): \"Your throne of glory, on high from the beginning etc.\" How do we know the name of the Messiah was? As it says (Psalms 72:17): \"May his name exist forever etc. [his name shall be Yinnon as long as the sun].\" Rabbi Ahavah said in the name of Rabbi Ze'ira: Even repentance was, as it says (Psalms 90:2): \"Before the mountains were birthed,\" and at the same time (Psalms 90:3), \"You turned man to contrition etc.\" However, I do not know which was first--if the Torah preceded the Throne of Glory or the Throne of Glory preceded the Torah. Rabbi Abba Bar Cahana said: The Torah preceded the Throne of Glory, as it says (Proverbs 8:22): \"God made me at the beginning of his way, the first of his works of old.\" This is before that of which it is written (Psalms 93:2): \"Your throne is established as of old.\" Rabbi Hunna and Rabbi Yirmiyah in the name of Rabbi Shmuel the son of Rabbi Yitzchak said: The thought of Israel was before everything. This is like a king who was married to a woman and did not have a son. One time the king was in the market and said: \"Take this ink and pen for my son.\" They said: \"He does not have a son.\" He replied: \"Take them; the king must expect a son, because otherwise he would not command that the ink and pen be taken.\" Similarly, if there was no expectation of Israel receiving it after 26 generations, God would not have written in the Torah: \"Command the children of Israel\" or \"Speak to the children of Israel.\" Rabbi Bannai said: The world and its contents were only created in the merit of the Torah, as it says (Proverbs 3:19): \"God founded the world with wisdom etc.\" Rabbi Berachiyah said: In the merit of Moses, as it says (Deuteronomy 33:21): \"He saw a first part for himself.\" Rabbi Hunna said in the name of Rabbi Matanah: The world was created in the merit of three things--challah, tithes, and first fruits. The verse \"In the beginning God created\" refers to challah, as it says (Numbers 15:20): \"The beginning of your doughs.\" It also refers to tithes, as it says (Deuteronomy 18:4): \"The beginning of your grains.\" It also refers to first fruits, as it says (Exodus 23:19): \"The beginning of the fruits of the land.\"",
            "Rabbi Hunna in the name of Bar Kafra opened with (Psalms 31:19): \"Let the lying lips be dumb, that speak against the righteous arrogantly with pride and contepmpt.\" Let them be bound, made dumb, and silenced. \"Let them be bound and made dumb\"--as it says (Exodus 4:11): \"Or who made one mute, or deaf, or seeing, or blind? Was it not I, God?\" and it says (Genesis 37:7): \"We were binding sheaves in the field, and my sheaf rose.\" (The word for 'sheaf' is similar to 'mute'.) \"Let them be silenced\"--as it sounds. \"Which speak against the righteous\"--the life of all worlds (God). \"Arrogantly\"--[on matters] he has hidden from his creatures (The word for 'arrogant' is similar to 'hidden'). \"In pride\"--to boast and say: \"I can explain creation.\" \"And contempt\"--to hold My glory in contempt. As Rabbi Yossi Bar Chanina said: One who honor's oneself at the expense of one's friend has no share in the World to Come. How much more so with the honor of God! And it says afterward (Psalms 31:20): \"How abundant is Your goodness that you have laid up for those who fear You.\" Those who fear You and not for those who hold Your awe in contempt. When a king builds a palace in a place of sewers, dunghills, and garbage, everyone who says: \"This palace is built on sewers, dunghills, and garbage\" discredits it. So too, everyone who says the universe was created from nothingness discredits it. Rabbi Hunna in the name of Bar Kafra said: If it were not written, it would be impossible to say it. \"In the beginning God created\" from what? \"And the earth was empty.\"",
            "Rabbi Yehudah Bar Simon opened with (Daniel 2:22): \"He reveals the deep and secret. He knows what is in the darkness, and the light dwells with Him.\" \"He reveals the deep\"--this is Hell, as it says (Proverbs 9:18): \"He does not know there are spirits there,\" and it says (Isaiah 30:33): \"deep and large\". \"And secret\"--this is Paradise, as it says (Isaiah 4:6): \"for a cover and refuge from storm and rain,\" and it says (Psalms 31:21): \"You hide them in the cover of Your presence.\" Alternatively, \"he reveals the deep and secret\"--these are the acts of the wicked, as it says (Isaiah 29:15): \"Woe to the ones who seek deep from God to make their counsel secret.\" \"And secret\"--these are the acts of the wicked, as the verse states. \"He knows what is in the dark\"--these are the acts of the wicked, as it says in Isaiah: \"Their acts are in the dark.\" \"The light dwells with Him\"--these are the acts of the righteous, as it is written (Proverbs 4:18): \"The path of the righteous is like the light at dawn,\" and it says (Psalms 97:11): \"Light is sown for the righteous.\" Rabbi Abba Srungia said: \"The light dwells with Him\"--this is the Messiah, as it says (Isaiah 60:1): \"Arise, shine, for your light has come.\" Rabbi Yehudah Bar Simon said: From the beginning of the creation of the world, \"he revealed the dark and secret\". \"In the beginning God created the heavens,\" but it is not explained. Where is it explained? Here (Isaiah 40:22): \"He stretches out the heavens like a curtain.\" \"And the land,\" but it is not explained. Where is it explained? Here (Job 37:6): \"For He says to the snow: 'Fall on the earth.'\" and (Job 38:38) \"When the dust runs into a mass, and the clods cleave together.\" \"And God said: 'Let there be light,'\" and it is not explained. Where is it explained? (Psalms 104:2) \"You cover Yourself with light like a garment.\"",
            "Rabbi Yitzchak opened with (Psalms 119:160): \"The beginning of Your word is truth, and Your righteous law is forever.\" Rabbi Yitzchak said: From the beginning of the creation of the world \"the beginning of Your word is truth.\" \"In the beginning God created\"--(Jeremiah 10:10) \"Your God is true.\" \"And Your righteous law is forever\"--that for every restriction that you place on your creations, they affirm the righteousness of your judgement and accept it with faith. No creation can say that two powers created the world. It is not written: \"the gods spoke\", but rather: \"God spoke\". It is not written: \"the gods said\", but rather: \"God said\". It is not written: \"in the beginning the gods created\", but rather: \"God created\".",
            "Rabbi Yehoshua Ben Levi said in the name of Rabbi Levi: Six things are required for building--water, dirt, wood, stone, rods, and iron. If you say he is rich, and does not need rods, he still needs measuring rods, as it says (Ezekiel 40:3): \"with a line of flax in his hand, and a measuring rod\". The Torah preceded these with six--\"the first\", \"of old\", \"forever\", \"from the start\", and \"from the first\" which is two, in the portion (Proverbs 8:22-23): \"God made me as the beginning of His way, the first of His works of old. I was set up forever, from the start, from the first of the Earth.\"",
            "",
            "Rabbi Yonah said in the name of Rabbi Levi: Why was the world created with a \"bet\"? Just as a bet is closed on all sides and open in the front, so you are not permitted to say, \"What is beneath? What is above? What came before? What will come after?\" Rather from the day the world was created and after. Bar Kappara said: \"You have but to inquire about bygone ages that came before you [ever since G-d created humanity on earth]\" (Deuteronomy 4:32). \"Ever since G-d created them\" you may speculate, however you may not speculate on what was before that. [\"From one end of Heaven to the other\"] on this you may speculate and investigate, but you may not speculate and investigate  0n what was before. Rabbi Yehudah ben Pazzi explained the Creation story according to Bar Kappara. Why was the world created with a \"bet\"? To teach you there are two worlds: this world and the world-to-come. D'var Acher: Why with a \"bet\"? Because it is the language of \"blessing.\" And why not with an \"aleph\"? Because it is the language of \"cursing.\"",

            "Rabbi Yehudah bar Rabbi Simon interpreted the text as referring to the generations. Now THE EARTH WAS UNFORMED: this refers to Adam, who was reduced to complete nothingness [on account of his sin], AND VOID refers to Cain, who desired to turn the world back to formlessness and emptiness. AND DARKNESS symbolises the generation of Enosh: And their works are in the dark (Isaiah 29:15). UPON THE FACE OF THE DEEP, the generations of the Flood: On the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up (Gen. 7:2); further, AND THE SPIRIT (RUACH) OF GOD HOVERED OVER THE FACE OF THE WATERS corresponds to And God made a wind (ruach) to pass over the earth (Gen. 8:1).

So, AND GOD SAID: LET THERE BE LIGHT: this alludes to Avraham, as it is written, Who hath raised up one from the east, whom He calleth in righteousness to His foot (Isaiah. 41:2)?

R' Yirmiyah ben Elazar says: not only with the Sea did Hashem stipulate, but with all that He created during the six days of Creation; thus it is written, 'From my hand I (i.e Hashem) stretched the heavens, and all their legions I have commanded,': I commanded the sea to split before Yisrael; I commanded the heavens and the earth to be silent before Moshe, as it is stated, 'Give ear, O heavens etc.'; I commanded the sun and the moon to stand still before Yehoshua, as it is stated, 'Sun, stand thou still upon Gibeon'; I commanded the ravens to sustain Eliyahu, as it is stated, 'And the ravens were bringing him etc.'; I commanded the fire not to harm Chanania, Mishael, and Azarya; I commanded the lions not to harm Daniel; I commanded the heavens to open to the voice of Yechezkel, as it is stated, 'The heavens opened etc.'; [and] I commanded the fish to spit out Yonah, as it is states, 'Hashem spoke to the fish and it spat out Yonah.'\"",

Once for the generation of the deluge, and once for the generation of Enosh, so that 'The Lord does and they shall fear before him' (Kohelet 3). This is comparable to a country that rebels against its king; the king sends a fierce legion and surrounds it so that the countrymen should see him and fear before him. Similarly, why does 'He gathereth the waters of the sea together as a heap?' (Tehilim 33:7). So that 'All the earth fear the Lord' (ibid v. 8).",

            "\"I will make him a helper corresponding to him.\"  If he merits it - a helper; if not - an enemy.  Rabbi Joshua the son of Nechemia said: If he merits it, [his helper] will be like the wife of Rabbi Hanina the son of Hachinai; if not, like the wife of Rabbi Yossi the Galilean.  Rabbi Yossi had a wife - who was his niece - whom he disparaged in front of his students.  They said to him: Why don't you divorce her, she does you no honor!  He said to them: she has a large dowry, and I cannot divorce her.  One time he was sitting and teaching with Rabbi Eleazar the son of Azariyah, and when they finished, Rabbi Eleazar suggested that they go to Rabbi Yossi's house.  Rabbi Yossi agreed, and so they went.  When they got there, Rabbi Yossi's wife was scornful, and when she had left [the room] Rabbi Yossi looked in the pot.  He said to her: there is nothing in the pot.  She said to him: there is bread crumbs and vegetables.  He went and found chickens.  Rabbi Eleazar the son of Azariyah knew what he heard [understood that the marriage was an unhappy one].  They sat and ate [in silence].  Rabbi Eleazar said to Rabbi Yossi: Rabbi!  You said that there was only bread and vegetables, and there was chicken!  He replied: it was a miracle.  When the meal was over, he said: Rabbi, you should leave this woman, she does not bring value to your life.  He replied: her dowry is large, and I cannot divorce her.  He said: we will cover the dowry, and you can divorce her.  They did this, and he divorced her, and he found another woman to marry, who was better than the first.  When he was finished financially supporting his first wife, she found and married a guardsmen of the town.  After some time, an injury befell him [the guardsmen] and he was blinded, and she would go out with him around the streets to beg.  When they approached the street of Rabbi Yossi, she turned around.  He [due to his job] was a knowledgeable man when it came to the layout of the town, and he said to her: why do you not lead me down the street of Rabbi Yossi, I have heard it is a very generous man?  She said: I was divorced from him, and I cannot face him now.  Another time they called upon the neighborhood of Rabbi Yossi.  He became angry with her on the first and second day, and eventually he started hitting her.  The noise traveled, and they were shamed in the city.  Rabbi Yossi examined the sound, and discovered that they were disgraced.  He asked him [the former guardsmen]: why do you hit her?  He replied: every day she deprives me of [potential] income from begging.  When Rabbi Yossi heard this, he immediately brought them into his house, and supported them for the rest of his life, according to the verse: \"And from your flesh do not turn away\" (Isaiah 58:7).",
            "\"And the Lord God created [animals] from the earth.\"  It asked of Rabbi Yochanan ben Zakkai: It is written: \"And the Lord said, let the earth bring forth living beings by kind\" (Genesis 1:24) - what is being taught by saying \"And the Lord God created all animals of the field\"?  He answered them: the earlier was about creation, and the later was about gathering [to be named], like the verse says: \"when you besiege a city for many days...\" (Deuteronomy 20:19).  Rabbi Aha said: when the Holy One, Blessed be He, came to create the world, he consulted the angels of the heavenly court.  He said to them: \"Let us make Adam\" (Genesis 1:26).  They said to him: this Adam, what is his nature?  He said to them: his wisdom exceeds yours.  He brought before them the domesticated beasts, the wild beasts, and the birds.  He said to them: what are their names?  They did not know.  He brought them before Adam.  He said to him: what are their names?  Adam said: this is a ox, this is a donkey, this is a cow, this is a camel.  And you, what is your name?  Adam said to him: it is fitting that I should be called 'Adam' as I was created from the earth [adamah].  And Me, what is My name?  Adam said to Him: it is fitting to call You Adonai, as You are the master [adon] of all your creations.  Rabbi Hiyyah said: \"I am God, that is my name\" (Isaiah 42:8).  \"That is my name\" - that Adam, the first person, called me.  God returned and brought before Adam pairs [of animals].  Adam said: to each and every one there is a pair, but I have no pair!  \"And for Adam no help-mate was found\" (Genesis 2:20).  And why did God not create her first?  Rather, The Holy One, Blessed be He, foresaw that Adam would be charges against her, and so he did not create her until Adam expressly requested it.  Once he requested it, immediately: \"And the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall...\" (Genesis 2:21)",
            "\"And the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall.\"  Rabbi Joshua of Sichnin in the name of Rabbi Levi said: the beginning of a man's downfall is sleep.  When asleep, he does not engage in study or work.  Rav said: there are three types of deep sleep: the deep sleep of sleep; the deep sleep of prophecy; and the deep sleep of a trance.  The deep sleep of sleep: \"And the Lord God caused a deep sleep [tardemah] to fall on Adam, and he slept\" (Genesis 2:21).  The deep sleep of prophecy: \"And the sun went down and a deep sleep [tardemah] fell over Avram\" (Genesis 15:12).  The deep sleep of a trance: \"And no one saw, and no one knew and no one awoke because all were sleeping, because the deep sleep [tardemah] of God has fallen on them\" (Samuel I 26:12).  The Rabbis said: [there is a fourth type] even the deep sleep of folly, as it is written: \"Because God poured upon you the spirit of deep sleep [tardemah]\" (Isaiah 29:9).  Rabbi Hanina bar Yitzchak said: there are three varieties of analogy: A taste of death - is sleep; a taste of prophecy - is dreaming; a taste of the world to come - is Shabbat.  Rabbi Avin added two more: a taste of the light of heaven - is the sun; a taste of the wisdom of heaven - is Torah.",
            "\"And He took one of his ribs.\"  Rabbi Shmuel bar Nachman said: from one of his sides, as it says: \"And for the side of the tabernacle\" (Exodus 26:20).

'From under it' was not written, rather \"from under them.\"  Rabbi Hanina the son of Rav Idi: from the beginning of the book until now there has not been a samech, once Eve was created, Satan was created with her.  And if you want to argue that man is the one that circles, the reply is that the text is talking about the rivers [that encircle Eden].  Rabbi Hanina bar Yitzchak said: The Holy one, Blessed be He, decorated his bottom so that he would not be disgraceful like an animal.  Rabbi Ami and Rabbi Yannai; one said: He made his buttocks a cover so that he would not be pained when he sat down, and one said: He made him covers.  Rabbi Levi and Rabbi Ami; one said: he made him bury, and one said: he made him burial garments.",
            "A certain matron asked Rabbi Yosi, saying: why did God steal [Adam's rib]?  He replied in a parable: if a person gave you a deposit of an ounce of silver in secret, and returned to you a pound of gold publicly, would that be stealing?  She said to him: so why was it done in secret?  He replied: at first, He created her, and Adam saw her full of secretions and blood.  He kept her away from him, and went back and created her a second time.  She said to him: I will add further, I was meant to marry my mother's brother, but because I grew up in the same house as him, I was unattractive in his eyes, and he went and married a different woman, who is less attractive than I am.  A story [is told] of a pious man and his wife who could not have kids.  They said: we are of no benefit to the Holy of of Blessing, so they divorced.  He went and married a wicked woman, and she made him wicked; and she went and married a wicked man, and she made him righteous.  Thus: everything is from the woman.",
            "They asked Rabbi Yehoshua: Why does a man come out [of the womb] with his face pointing down, and a woman with her face pointing up?  He said to them: the man looks to the place he was created, and the woman looks to the place she was created.  And why does a woman need to perfume herself, and the man does not need to perfume himself?  He said to them: man is created from the earth, and the earth is never smelly.  Woman was created from bone.  It is similar to placing meat out for three days without salting it, it would become smelly immediately.  And why does a woman's voice carry, while a man's does not?  He said to them: it is similar to filling a pot with meat, no sound comes forth.  Once you put a bone into it, immediately a sound comes forth.  Why is man easily appeased, and woman is not easily appeased?  He said to them: man is created from the earth, and when you put one drop of water on the earth, it dissolves.  Woman was created from a bone, and even if you soak a bone in water for days it does not dissolve.  Why does man search for woman, and woman does not search for man?  He said to them: to what is the matter similar?  To one who lost an object - he searches for the object, while the object does not search for him.  Why does man entrust his seed to the woman [by impregnating her], and woman does not entrust seed to the man?  He said to them: it is similar to one who has a surety, and wants to find a trustworthy person to guard it.  Why does man leave [the house] with an uncovered head, while woman leaves the house with a covered head?  He said to them: [it is similar to] one who committed a sin and is embarrassed from people, and therefore leaves with a covered head.  And why do women accompany the dead first?  He said to them: because they caused death to enter the world, therefore they escort the dead first, as it says: \"and after him each person will draw\" (Job 21:33).  And why was woman given the commandment of niddah?  Because she spilled the blood of the first man, therefore she was given the commandment of niddah.  And why was she given the commandment of challah?  Because she disgraced the first man, who was the sanctification (challah) of creation, therefore she was given the commandment of challah.  And why was woman given the commandment of lighting Shabbat candles?  He said to them: because she put out the soul of the first man, therefore she was given the commandment of Shabbat candles."

            "\"And God built [out of] the rib\" - Rabbi Eliezer said in the name of Rabbi Yossi the son of Zimra: woman was endowed with more understanding than man.  As it is taught: at eleven years and one day, her vows stick; at twelve years and one day her vows apply; and all twelve-year-olds are checked.  But for males, at twelve years and one day his vows stick; at thirteen years they apply, and all thirteen-year-olds are checked.  Rabbi Yirmiya said in the name of Rabbi Shmuel bar Yitzchak: there are those that say the opposite, as the way of a woman is to sit in her home, and the way of a many is to go out to the marketplace and learn understanding from others.  Rabbi Aybu said, and some attribute it to the name of Rabbi Benaya, and it is [also] taught in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yochai: [God] adorned her [Eve] like a bride, and afterwards brought her to him [Adam].  In some places they call 'kil'ata' [braids] 'bin'yata' [net-works].  Rabbi Hamma bar Chanina said: you think that she was brought to him under a carob or sycamore tree, rather she was adorned with twenty four kinds of finery, and then brought to him, as it says: \"In Eden, the garden of God you were, and all precious stones were your covering: the carnelian, the topaz...\" (Ezekiel 28:13).  The Rabbis and Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish; the Rabbis said: ten, and Rabbi Shimon said: eleven.  Rabbi Hamma bar Chanina and Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish both said: a general rule followed by a specific; follow the general rule by adding the specific, and it is all in the general rule - \"every precious stone is your covering\" is a general rule.  \"Carnelian, topaz, emerald, beryl...\" are the specifics.  Follow the general rule - \"every precious stone is your covering.\"  Rabbi Levi and Rabbi Simon: one said nine, and one said ten.  The one who said ten is like the Rabbis, and the one who said nine argues that the \"gold\" mentioned in the verse surely does not refer to a canopy.  Rabbi Acha bar Chanina said: he made walls of gold and coverings of precious stones and pearls.  Rabbi Eleazar bar Bisna said in the name of Rabbi Aha: He even made him hooks of gold.",
            "Rabbi Yehoshua of Sichnin said in the name of Rabbi Levi: \"And He built\" is written; He contemplated from where to create her.  He said: I will not create her from the head, lest she be haughty; I will not create her from the eye, lest she be coquettish; I will not create her from the ear, lest she be an eavesdropper; I will not create her from the mouth, lest she be a chatter-box; I will not create her from the heart, lest she be jealous; I will not create her from the hand, lest she be a thief; I will not create her from the leg, lest she be a run-about; rather, I will create create her from the most modest place on a person, as even when a person stands naked this place is covered.  And as He created each and every limb of the woman, He would say to her: be a modest woman, be a modest woman!  Nevertheless, \"And they have disregarded all of my counsel\" (Proverbs 1:25).  I did not create her from the head, and yet she is haughty, as it says: \"And they walk with stretched-forth necks\" (Isaiah 3:16).  And not from the eye, yet she is coquettish, as it says: \"and with wanton eyes\" (ibid.).  And not from the ear, and yet she is an eavesdropper, as it says: \"And Sarah listened from the entrance of the tent\" (Genesis 18:10).  And not from the heart, and yet she is jealous, as it says: \"And Rachel was jealous of her sister\" (Genesis 30:1).  And not from the hand, and yet she is a thief, as it says: \"And Rachel stole the idols\" (Genesis 31:19).  And not from the leg, and yet she is a run-about, as it says: \"And Dinah went out...\" (Genesis 34:1).",
            "Rav Hisda said: He built her an extra store-room [womb] more than the man, wider at the bottom and narrower at the top, so that it could receive fetuses.  \"And He brought her to the man\" - Rabbi Avin said: happy is the townsperson, who has the King as a friend.",
            "\"And Adam said: this is now...\"  Rabbi Yehuda bar Rebbi said: In the beginning He created her, and [Adam] saw that she was full of secretions and blood and separated her from him, and He returned and created her a second time.  As it says: \"this is now\" this is the woman this time.  This is now for me the one who will be my partner in the future.  As it says: \"A golden bell (pa'amon) and a pomegranate\" (Exodus 28:34).  \"This is now\" - this is she that perturbed me all night.  It was asked before Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish: why was Adam not tired from all his dreams, but was tired from this one [Eve]?  He said to them: because at the beginning of her creation she was just a dream, as it says: \"bone of my bones, flesh of my flesh.\"  Rabbi Tanhuma said: if a man marries a relative, of him it is written: \"bone of my bones.\"  \"This one shall be called 'woman' because she was taken from man.\"  From here we learn that Torah was given in Hebrew.  Rabbi Pinchas and Rabbi Hilkiya in the name of Rabbi Simon said: just as the Torah was given in Hebrew, so too the world was created in Hebrew.  You have heard it said: 'man' and 'woman' [in other languages as distinct words, unrelated to each other], so why ish and isha [the words for 'man' and 'woman' in Hebrew, which are related to each other]?  Because this word falls from this word [and, hence, the grammatical inconsistency is explained if the Torah was given in Hebrew].",
            "\"Therefore a man will abandon.\"  It was taught: a convert that converted and was married to his sister, whether from the mother or the father - it is acceptable, according to Rabbi Meir.  The Sages say: from the mother it is acceptable, from the father, it must be established that he does not worship idols.  A refutation arose: does it not say: \"And moreover, she is my sister, the daughter of my father...\" (Genesis 20:12)!  He said to them: reply to them by their own reasoning.  Rabbi Meir refuted: \"Therefore a man will abandon his father and his mother\" (Genesis 2:24).  Rabbi Yochanan said: they explained this verse \"therefore a man will abandon his father and his mother\" the one who supports his father, the one who supports his mother.  Rabbi Abahu refuted: does it not say: \"And Amram took Yocheved his cousin\" (Exodus 6:20)!  Rabbi Shimon the son of Rabbi Abahu said: from here would we learn that  at the time of the children of Noah, Israel acted differently, before the giving of the Torah!?  Rabbi Levi said: we explain the verse \"therefore a man will abandon...\" the one who is supported by his father, or by his mother.  Rabbi Abahu in the name of Rabbi Yochanan said: the children of Noah, in matters of marriage are obligated, in matters of engagement are not.  Rabbi Yonah in the name of Rabbi Shmuel said: if a whore is in the marketplace, and two men come to her, the first is exempt and the second is liable, because he was sleeping with a married woman.  Did the first one intend to acquire her [as a wife]?!  It is said: intercourse at the time of the children of Noah acquires, even not in the way of [later] Judaism.  And how do we know that they did not divorce?  Rabbi Yehuda in the name of Rabbi Simon and Rabbi Chanin in the name of Rabbi Yochanan said: they did not divorce, or they both divorced each other.  Rabbi Yochanan said: his wife divorced him and gave him a bill of divorce.  Rabbi Hiyya taught: an idol-worshipper that divorced his wife, and she went and married someone else, and then they both went and converted to Judaism, I do not apply to them the verse \"The first husband that sent her away cannot...\" (Deuteronomy 24:4).  Rabbi Aha in the name of Rabbi Hanina bar Pappa said: in the whole book of Malachi it is written 'Hashem, Lord of Hosts' but here it is written 'the God of Israel' as it says: \"For I hate sending away, said Hashem, God of Israel\" (Malachi 2:16) - as if to say, God's name only rests on Israel.  Rabbi Haggai said: When Israel was exiled, the women's faces were blackened from the sun, and they were left and the men went and married Amonite women.  They went and circled the altar, crying, as Malachi says: \"And this do a second time\" (Malachi 2:13) - a second time in relation to Shittim.  \"Cover with tears the altar of Hashem with wailing and sighing\" (ibid.), the Holy One Blessed be He said: who will accept these tears and wailing, since you stole and did violence to and took it's beauty from her, now you will send her away?  And how do we know that they were fastidious about sexual impropriety like Israel?  As it says: \"And he cleaved to his wife\" (Genesis 2:24) and not the wife of his friend, or another man, or an animal.  Rabbi Shmuel and Rabbi Abahu and Rabbi Eleazar in the name of Rabbi Hanina said: a child of Noah who comes to his wife unnaturally is liable for the death penalty.  Rabbi Assi said: every crime written about the children of Noah is not judged on the metric of positive and negative commandments; rather, they all require the death penalty.  How do we know this?  \"And he cleaved to his wife and they became as one flesh\" (ibid.).",
            "\"And they were both naked.\"  Rabbi Eleazar said: there were three who did not wait for their contentment even six hours, and these are they: Adam, and Israel, and Sisra.  Adam, as it says: \"and they were not embarrassed\" (Genesis 2:25) - six hours had not passed, and he was content.  Israel, as it says: \"And the nation saw that Moses delayed\" (Exodus 32:1), when six hours had passed and Moses had not appeared.  Sisra, as it says: \"Why does his chariot delay in coming?\" (Judges 5:28) - every day he would come in three or four hours, and today six hours have past and he is not here - these are all cases related to \"and they were not embarrassed.\"  \"And the snake was crafty\" (Genesis 3:1) - the text only needed to continue with \"And Hashem God made for Adam and his wife...\" (Genesis 3:21).  Rabbi Yehoshua ben Karchah said: to teach you which temptation the snake sprung on them - he saw them engaged in the way of the world, and desired here.  Rabbi Yaakov of the village of Hannin said: to not pause the story of the snake."

And they will say: they were slandering each other, and the Holy One of Blessing will take both groups and lower them to Hell.  Another reading: \"A slanderer\" - this is the snake, who slandered his Creator.  \"Will not be established in the land\" \"On your belly\" (Genesis 3:14).  'A violent and wicked man will be hunted and pushed' is not said, but rather \"pushed repeatedly\" (Psalms 140:12) - Adam was cursed, Even was cursed, and the snake was cursed.",

Rather, God jumped in and decreed his punishment.",
            "\"And the Lord, God said to the snake, because you did this.\"  Rabbi Hiyya taught: In commendation, start from the greatest, and in cursing, start from the smallest.  In commendation start from the greatest, as it says: \"And Moses said to Aaron and Eleazar and Itamar\" (Leviticus 10:6).  In cursing, because with the smallest, as it says: \"And the Lord, God said to the snake...And to the woman He said: I will surely increase your suffering in childbirth...And to the Man He said: because you listened to your wife\" (Genesis 3:14-17).  This teaches that first He cursed the snake, then Eve, and then Adam.  Every creature has sexual relations face-to-neck, except for two that have relations backside-to-backside: the camel and the dog, and except for three that have relations face-to-face, because the Shechina [God's presence] spoke to them, and these are them: humans, snakes, and fish.  Humans, as it says: \"And to Adam He said: because you listened to your wife.\"  Snakes, \"And the Lord, God spoke to the snake.\"  Fish, \"And God spoke to the fish, and it spit up Jonah\" (Jonah 2:11).",
            "\"Because you did this.\"  Rabbi Hoshaya said: because of this [other thing], all your activities were for this [other thing].  Rabbi Yehuda the son of Simon said in the name of Rabbi Hoshaya: from the beginning of the book until now there have been seventy-one utterances of God's name, teaching that he [the snake] was judged by the Great Sanhedrin.  Rabbi Hoshaya of Sicnin said in the name of Rabbi Levi: he was cursed with leprosy, and this became the pattern on his back, as it was originally leprosy.  Rabbi Eleazar said: you have seen in your day that after a man hits his fellow with a stick, he will hit him with a strap.  Similarly: \"you will be accursed among all animals\" - all the more so \"from all the beasts of the field\" (Genesis 3:14).  It was taught: a fat pure domesticated animal gives birth in nine months; a fat impure domesticated animal gives birth in twelve months; a skinny pure domesticated animal gives birth in five months; the dog in fifty days; the cat in fifty-two; the pig in sixty; the marten in seventy; the deer and the fox in six months; the rest of the insects in six months; the lion, bear, panther, elephant, monkey, and porcupine in three years; and the snake in seven years; and the viper in seventy years!  A philosopher wanted to know how long it took for a snake to give birth - when he saw them copulating, he took them, put them in a box and gave them enough food to live on until they gave birth.  When the elders arrived in Rome, they asked Rabban Gamliel: how long does it take a snake to give birth?  He could not answer them, and he blanched.  Rabbi Yehoshua encountered him, and his face was sickly.  He said to him: why is your face sickly?  He said to him: I was asked a question that I could not answer.  He said to him: what is the question?  He said: 'how long does it take for a snake to give birth?'  He said to him: seven years.  He said to him: how do you know that?  He said to him: the dog, a wild, impure animal, gives birth in fifty days; and a pure domesticated animal gives birth in twelve months.  It is written: \"You will be accursed among all the animals and all the beasts of the field\" - just as the wild animal is cursed seven times more than the domesticated animal, so too the snake is cursed seven times more than the wild animal.  That very night, Rabban Gamliel went to see the philosopher, and told him.  He began hitting his head against the wall, and said: all the toil I put in over seven years, and this one comes and tells me the answer effortlessly.",

Similarly it is written, Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters that are found (Gen. XIX, 15)3: R. Tobiah said: That means two ‘finds’, viz. Ruth and Naamah. R. Yitzchak commented: I have found David My servant (Ps. LXXXIX, 21): where did I find him? In Sodom."

            "2) \"The sun also rises, and the sun goes down, etc.\" (Eccl. 1:5) R. Abba said: Do we then not know that the sun rises and the sun goes down? But the meaning is that before the Holy One, blessed be He, causes the sun of one righteous man to set, He causes the sun of another righteous man to rise. Thus, on the day that R. Akiba died our Teacher was born, and they applied to him the verse, “The sun also rises, and the sun goes down.” On the day that our Teacher died R. Adda b. Ahabah was born, and they applied the same verse to him. On the day that R. Adda b. Ahabah died R. Abin was born, and the same was applied to him. On the day that R. Abin died, his son R. Abin was born. On the day that R. Abin [junior] died Abba Hoshaya of Traya was born. On the day that Abba Hoshaya of Traya died R. Hoshaya was born, and that verse was applied to him. Before the Holy One, blessed be He, caused Moses' sun to set, He caused Joshua's sun to rise, as it says, “And the Lord said unto Moses: Take Joshua the son of Nun, etc. (Num.27:18). Before the sun of Joshua set, the sun of Othniel, the son of Kenaz, rose, as it says, “And Othniel the son of Kenaz took it” (Josh. 15:17). Before Eli's sun set the sun of Samuel rose, as it says, “And the lamp of God was not yet gone out, and Samuel was laid down to sleep in the Temple of the Lord” (1 Sam. 3:3). Said R. Johanan: Like a calf without blemish. Before the Holy One, blessed be He, allowed Sarah's sun to set, He caused that of Rebekah to rise. Thus we first read, “Behold, Milcah, she also has borne children (Gen. 22:20), and after that, ”AND THE LIFE OF SARAH WAS A HUNDRED YEARS, etc.”"

For thirteen years both went to school and came home from school, [but] after this age, one went to the house of study and the other to idolatrous shrines.

Jacob said; Abraham did not establish them , Isaac did not establish them, if the twelve stones join together, I know that I will merit twelve tribes. Once they did he knew he was going to merit establishing the twelve tribes . Rabbi Nehemiah said he took 3 stones. Jacob took three stones and said : God placed  his name on Abraham, and on Isaac.  I, if the stones join together, I know that God is the unifying name for me.  And since joined, he knew that God would unify his names with Jacob. The Rabbis said that the minimum of the plural of stones is 2. Abraham produced negative attributes/waste- Ishmael and the sons of Keturah . And Isaac produced Esau and his generals. I, if you join these 2 stones together, I know that I will not produce any negative attributes in my descendants.",
